Quick TL;DR written in non-legalese plain English:

*(Full Standards of Conduct must be agreed to below)*

We're all here to have fun and enjoy the company of likeminded individuals, some of which may never have met in-person, or at least see each other in real life very infrequently.

Furries are a diverse selection of individuals from all walks of life with various aspects of origin, nationality, creed, identity, neurology, interest, and belief. What an individual knows or holds dear and valuable may or may not precisely match with yours.

Some point at a familiar franchise, art style, species, or interest and identify or bond with it, while others take to various artistic medium to express and create their own vision. This variety is what makes our fandom that much more special and different than others.

That said, this is also a place of community, so we ask that all in attendance conduct themselves in a respectful manner, and not go out of their way to maliciously wreck somebody's day.

This is some people's hard-earned Paid Time Off, or maybe even their one annual vacation from the mundane world. Please don't ruin that for them. Please don't be the problem. Please be considerate of others.

**Don't be "That Guy".**

Lastly, Staff are unpaid volunteers who are trying their best to put on an event they think a large crowd of likeminded individuals will enjoy. This fandom is their home as much as it is yours. Please treat them with respect and they will strive to return that in kind.

But most importantly, be safe and have fun.<br>

{{< center >}}# Standards of Conduct{{< /center >}}

This is the Standards of Conduct for Anthrocon, Inc. and all events sponsored by Anthrocon, Inc.; these entities are referred to as ‘Anthrocon’ henceforth.

The primary purpose of Anthrocon is for our attendees to have fun. To ensure that the greatest number of people do so, we have established these Standards of Conduct. These rules are to ensure that the behavior of any one small group does not disturb the membership as a whole, and does not detract from the comfortable atmosphere of the convention. Anthrocon welcomes all parties with an interest in anthropomorphic animals; however, the convention's management reserves the right to deny or revoke the membership of any individual at any time for any reason.

Anthrocon also reserves the right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice and reserves the sole right of interpretation. These rules must be followed by attendees. In any dispute, the general rule above will apply. If you have any questions, please contact our staff for assistance.

Anyone who accepts a membership agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Anthrocon from any claim for personal injuries or other damages or equity arising out of any individual's activities at Anthrocon, even if such injury or damage is caused by negligence by or on the part of Anthrocon.

As a condition of membership, all Anthrocon attendees are required to abide by these standards of conduct for the entire duration of their stay, even prior to Opening Ceremonies or after Closing Ceremonies.

### The golden rule

The following rule supersedes all others listed below and may be invoked at any time:

**Any action or behavior that causes significant interference with convention operations, excessive discomfort to other attendees, or adversely affects Anthrocon's relationship with its guests, its venues, or the public is strictly forbidden and may result in permanent suspension of membership.**

### General Rating of the Convention

All convention space is considered to be "PG" at all times, with the exception of events or exhibits that are specifically noted to be inappropriate for minors and with access only for adults.

Public displays of affection should be kept to those appropriate for polite company. Please express your devotion to your significant other either in appropriate ways, or in private.

### Clothing Guidelines

Any Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), such as masks, required by venues or other Anthrocon policies must be worn.

Shirts, pants/shorts/skirts, and footwear must be worn when in areas of hotels or the convention center that are accessible to non-attendees, such as lobbies, restaurants, and concourses, except for hotel swimming pools. Full-body fursuits qualify as shirts, pants, and footwear provided that the costume is not unacceptably suggestive. Fursuiters must respect the policies of hotels and other venues regarding areas where costumes are not allowed, which may include restaurants and hotel swimming pools.

When in public areas, attendees may not wear clothing or accessories which are overly revealing, inappropriate to the atmosphere of the convention, or likely to draw reasonable complaint or offense. This includes clothing or accessories that are fetish-related or restrict mobility, such as a leash attached to an otherwise acceptable collar.

Other than fursuits for which the inclusion of a uniform as a costume accessory is obvious, police uniforms, tactical gear or other outfits which may be easily mistaken for such are only to be worn by law enforcement on active duty.

In certain circumstances, clothing or accessories that might otherwise be considered inappropriate may be included as part of a costume if specific approval is granted by Anthrocon’s Safety Team.

### Public Decorum

No items of any kind may be thrown, flown, or dropped from hotel or Convention Center balconies or patios.

No water pistols, silly string, or any thrown, flown, or projectile item may be used in any area of hotels or the Convention Center.

Lighter-than-air balloons may not be brought into the Convention Center.

For safety, only handheld glowsticks are permitted in the dances. Glowsticks on strings or on polearms must be cleared with Safety staff before being used. The decision of the Safety staff on any particular item will be final.

Please do not sleep in convention space or hotel lobbies; return to your hotel room or home.

In order to minimize the spread of contagion (commonly known as “con crud”), anyone showing any sign of illness, regardless of cause, must wear a CDC-approved mask or will otherwise be asked to leave convention space. Anthrocon cannot provide masks for this purpose.

Anthrocon attendees must abide by instructions given by Anthrocon Safety staff. Failure to do so will result in loss of membership privileges. Any disputes or concerns may be addressed onsite at Convention Operations.

Anthrocon convention space is open only to members, and all attendees should wear their membership badges at all times. A badge is valid only for the person to whom it was issued; badges may not be shared under any circumstances.

Knowingly transporting, hosting, or otherwise enabling an individual that is unwelcome at Anthrocon to attend or enter convention space will result in permanent revocation of Anthrocon membership privileges.

### Harassment

Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated at the convention. **If you have been the target of harassment, we urge you to report the incident immediately to a member of Safety or to Convention Operations.** The sooner an issue is reported to us, the more appropriately we can address it.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

(a) Physical assault, battery, stalking, or unwelcome physical attentions.

(b) Conduct, dress, or speech that targets, threatens, intimidates, or is otherwise intended to cause distress to other attendees, or members of protected classes (such as those based on race, age, religion, national origin, disability, gender, or sexual identity).

If people tell you "no" or ask you to leave them alone, your business with them is done. If you continue to attempt contact with them, you may be removed from the premises and have membership privileges permanently revoked. Remember: "A costume does not imply consent."

Anyone who has been convicted of a crime of violence against another person for which they are required to register with any state or local law enforcement agency may be denied membership to the convention at the sole discretion of Anthrocon, Inc.

### Attendance by Minors

Anyone who is under the age of 18 years at any time during the convention must present a signed and notarized parental permission form (or consent assignment form) unless accompanied by a parent or able to produce evidence of legal emancipation. There are no exceptions.

Minors are not permitted under any circumstances to enter areas designated for mature audiences.

Anyone providing false documentation of identity or age will be denied membership and reported to the police.

### Service Animal Policy

Pets are not permitted in convention space. Service dogs (as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA, Title II) are permitted in convention space provided that they are under appropriate control. *Emotional Support Animals and Therapy Animals are NOT considered service dogs by the ADA, and are not permitted in convention space.*

### Hotel Matters

Anthrocon partner hotels will have their own rules, policies, and terms and conditions customers of those hotels will be expected to abide by. These rules, policies, and terms and conditions may be more stringent than those set forth here. Where the rules, policies, or terms and conditions of a partner hotel differ from or are more stringent than those set forth herein, those policies control all conduct in that space. Attendees are expected to abide by such policies as if they are set forth herein at length. If attendees have issues or concerns with such policies, they should raise them with Anthrocon, Inc. so Anthrocon may address such concerns with our partner hotels as necessary.

### Hotel Party Policy

Gatherings in hotel rooms must not make noise that can be heard in neighboring rooms during nighttime hours. Hotel doors must be kept shut during such gatherings and guests are not permitted to congregate in the hotel corridors.

Loud parties will be given a single warning to remain quiet. No second warnings will be given before action is taken by the hotel to remove the offending individuals.

Hotel guests who host any gathering are responsible for cleaning up afterward. Please plan to bag excessive amounts of trash so that housekeeping is not overburdened.

### Other Hotel Matters

Any act of vandalism, deliberate or excessive damage to hotel property, or interference with any hotel or Convention Center workers in the performance of their duties will result in permanent revocation of Anthrocon membership, criminal prosecution, fines, or any combination thereof.

Please do not affix any stickers, posters, or other objects to the walls or doors in any hotel or Convention Center, to the elevators, to Anthrocon signage, or to hotel room doors. Any person found in violation of this rule will have their membership permanently revoked and will be barred from the premises.

The person in whose name a room is rented is solely responsible for the conduct of all individuals in the room as well as for the condition of the room. Excessive trash, soiling or other damage to hotel property, or any circumstance that may present a hazard to hotel housekeeping staff may result in permanent loss of Anthrocon membership privileges.

Hotel Housekeeping staff are required by corporate policy to inspect every room once per day, even if the room is not to be serviced. In some of our partner hotels, Housekeepers will delay their rounds for our benefit, and will initially bypass rooms with "do not disturb" signs on the doors. At the end of their rounds they must return to those rooms and will knock on the door. Attendees must allow housekeeping staff access to the room to inspect it at that time, even if the "do not disturb" sign is displayed.

Overly large requests for room amenities such as towels and pillows will not be honored. Kindly bring such extra items from home if you anticipate the need.

### Sales of Goods and Services

The offering for sale of any goods or services at the convention may only occur in appropriate and authorized areas of convention space, only at authorized times, and only by registered, authorized vendors of the area in question. In all cases sales will be governed by the applicable rules of each area, such as the Dealer Rules & Information Packet for the Dealers Room. Unauthorized sales of any goods or services may result in revocation of membership.

### Smoking, Alcohol, and Substance Abuse

Smoking is not permitted in any area inside the Westin or the Convention Center. This includes electronic cigarettes, at the request of venue management. Smokers are asked to use designated smoking areas, to properly dispose of cigarette butts, and to comply with any other venue rules.

Anthrocon asks that any bottled alcoholic beverages be brought promptly to hotel rooms for storage or responsible consumption. No alcoholic beverages may be brought into nor consumed in convention space unless said beverage has been approved by Convention Center management as part of a programming event.

Any possession or use of alcoholic beverages in the convention center without the explicit permission of the staff of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center is grounds for the immediate revocation of membership without further warning. If membership is revoked for such reason, no refund will be considered or given.

Anyone knowingly or unknowingly providing alcohol to anyone under the age of 21 may be removed from the convention and be reported to the authorities. It is the sole responsibility of persons serving alcohol in room parties to ensure that every person in attendance is over the age of 21, even if that person is not drinking alcohol. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is extremely serious about this law and we ask our members to respect it.

The sale, distribution, or use of any illegal or controlled substances is not welcome at Anthrocon. Any individual found to be distributing such substances will be removed and reported directly to the authorities. For safety, any obviously intoxicated or impaired attendees will be asked to return to their room or seek medical attention until the effects have passed.

The possession and use of any controlled substance which is legal in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania must be done in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh, and the rules and policies of the venue, partner hotel, or other such location.

### Weapons Policy

No actual weapons or any item that can be easily mistaken for one may be carried either openly or concealed at any time in convention space, regardless of any government permits which you may possess. Exceptions may be made only for duly appointed law enforcement officers by prior arrangement with the Safety Department. Personal pocket knives with single-edged blades less than 4 inches long are permitted.

Realistic weapon replicas are permitted as part of a costume only during costume events such as the Fursuit Parade and must be appropriately peace-bonded; ask the Safety Department for instruction on how to do so. They must be cased or otherwise secured when being carried outside of costume.

### Media Relations and Use of Anthrocon Images or Footage

All journalists, media photographers, and any other members of the press are required to display an official Anthrocon Press Badge or be accompanied by a senior Anthrocon staff member at all times while in convention space. Members of the press who have not been issued a Press Badge may not conduct interviews or take photographs, audio or video footage without an escort.

If members of the media are present, attendees must act responsibly. Media representatives who do not have Press Badges and are not escorted by an Anthrocon staff member should be reported to Anthrocon Safety staff or to Convention Operations immediately. *Do not speak to any unbadged and unescorted members of the press!*

Anthrocon members should be aware that audio and/or video recordings are frequently made in convention space and that their likenesses may appear in those recordings. Certain areas of convention space, as well as certain convention personnel, may be fitted with audio and/or video recording devices for the purpose of enhancing the safety and security of our attendees. Individual members agree to assign without compensation the use of their likeness(es) at Anthrocon for the use of promotional material such as highlight videos.

The name "Anthrocon" and the Anthrocon logo are registered service marks of Anthrocon, and must not be used in any fashion that disparages or dilutes that mark. Members agree to remove from circulation or publication any image or recording that in the sole opinion of Anthrocon, Inc. misrepresents or defames its service mark.

Anthrocon receives requests each year for Press/Media Passes from personal bloggers as well as journalistic media. Please note that Anthrocon does not require a press pass for individual bloggers or podcasters so long as they are not attempting to:

A. Conduct recorded interviews of any type with any Anthrocon attendee or member in Anthrocon space.<br>
B. Film documentary footage of Anthrocon spaces, events, or attendees.<br>
C. Exhibiting or recording behavior that is in violation of the Anthrocon Standards of Conduct.

Anthrocon considers recorded interviews of any type performed in Anthrocon spaces to be a form of media representation and requires an approved Anthrocon Press Pass. Please note that if determined necessary, an Anthrocon Press Pass may require an escort and can be revoked at any time. An Anthrocon Press Pass is not a substitute for a membership. Determination as to whether or not a Press Pass is required rests solely with Anthrocon.

### Payments and Money Matters

Anthrocon accepts most major credit and debit cards. Chargebacks (denying a charge) that are made for the purpose of avoiding payment to Anthrocon or of avoiding hotel cancellation fees, that are made without sufficient cause, or that are made without first attempting to resolve the dispute with Anthrocon may result in permanent revocation of membership privileges and possible legal action.

Checks that are presented against insufficient funds will be charged a fee of $30 per check.

Members who have an outstanding balance due to Anthrocon must settle that balance before being permitted to attend the convention.

Please note that Anthrocon is a 501(c)7 nonprofit organization. As such, donations to the organization are **not deductible** from individual U.S. Federal income taxes.

Anthrocon cannot involve itself in financial disputes between individual members, and cannot divulge information about an individual member to any party other than to banking officials or legal authorities.

### Technology Policy

The usage of any technology or device in a way that is malicious in nature will not be tolerated, regardless of the reason — there are no exceptions. Examples of usage defined as "malicious" include, but are not limited to:

- Disrupting or interrupting any digital signal or frequency
- Stealing, duplicating, or reading/sniffing other signals or frequencies
- "Hacking" any digital device, service, or system that belongs to an Anthrocon attendee, the convention, or the venue(s)
- Any other action or behavior by a device that causes harmful or disruptive impact to the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of any system.

Any instance of the above, regardless whether or not deemed criminal in nature, will be reported to the appropriate authorities in addition to any consequences determined by Anthrocon, Inc.

### Miscellaneous Notes

The standards of conduct for Anthrocon will be enforced by Anthrocon Safety Staff. Please remember that your membership badge is the property of Anthrocon, and must be presented and/or surrendered to any Staff member requesting it. If you have any problem with any action taken by a Staff member you may take the matter up with the Safety Head or with Anthrocon's Chairman.

Please be reminded that these rules involve "worst-case" scenarios and are put into place to ensure the safety and comfort of our members. They are also not all-inclusive; in all cases, the singular rule that supersedes all others is: "*Any action or behavior that causes significant interference with convention operations, excessive discomfort to other attendees, or adversely affects Anthrocon's relationship with its guests, its venue, or the public is strictly forbidden and may result in revocation of membership privileges.*"

We anticipate no difficulties, as our members as a whole are rational and responsible people. Anthrocon is prepared to handle difficulties as efficiently as possible should they occur. We thank our members for their past cooperation and for their continued assistance in making this a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. Please remember to be courteous of those around you, and have fun!
