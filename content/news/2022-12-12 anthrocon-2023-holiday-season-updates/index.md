Hello Anthrocon attendees! With the holiday season in full swing and the new year quickly approaching, now’s a great time to talk about some updates and important details for our 2023 convention!

## REGISTRATION

Anthrocon registration is currently open, with early bird pricing valid until January 29th, 2023. Keep in mind that this year, **attendees must be registered for Anthrocon to reserve an Anthrocon-block hotel room**. Those who register prior in the early bird period will receive an email when general hotel reservations open, containing the link needed to reserve a hotel room. To review all of the newest updates and policies regarding registration, please visit the [**registration information page**](/registration).

## Transition to cashless payments

With our efforts to shift our existing payment practices to digital and card-focused options, we are announcing that **Registration**, **Con Store**, and **Art Show** will begin to transition to a cashless payment system. We will be strongly encouraging all attendees to prepare forms of payment such as credit card, debit card, or mobile payment when making purchases at these places during the convention. In addition, the convention center’s establishments, such as food and refreshment stations, will only accept cashless payment methods. **Dealers Room** and **Artists Alley** will not be transitioned to cashless payments, as the method of preferred payment is determined by individual vendors. We’ll have more information coming soon in updated FAQs.

## HOTEL

Hotel room bookings will start in late January for both Dealers and those who have registered Ultrasponsor/Supersponsor, with general booking for Sponsors and regular attendees beginning shortly after in early February. If you have not yet, please review the new Anthrocon Hotel Booking Policy on our [**Hotels page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/hotel).

## FURSUIT CRUISES

If you’re looking for a great last-minute holiday gift, or wish to secure your spot for a memorable adventure on the Allegheny River, tickets for our special River Cruises are available, in partnership with the Gateway Clipper Fleet! This year we are offering five hour-long Sightseeing cruises at various times on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, along with a special catered Dinner Cruise (Friday night at 7:30) and Cocktail Cruise (Saturday night at 7:30). For more information or to book tickets, visit the [**Anthrocon River Cruises**](https://www.anthrocon.org/anthrocon-river-cruises) information page.

## PERFORMANCE AUDITION FORM & PANEL SUBMISSIONS

If you are musically or theatrically inclined and wish to schedule a performance on Anthrocon’s Main Stage, there is an audition form available to fill out on our Events page. Main Stage time is limited, so please apply early! Applications to host regular panels such as Meet & Greets, Seminars, Discussions, Demonstrations, Educational Talks, etc. are also available on our [**Events and Panels page**](/events-panels). The success of Anthrocon’s programming relies on you - we encourage everyone interested to contribute and be part of one of the largest and most diverse panel tracks in furry fandom, while meeting other furry fans with shared interests!
