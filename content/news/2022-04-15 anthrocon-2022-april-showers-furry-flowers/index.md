While our attempt to make the title rhyme might not have been amazing, our efforts to get things ready for Anthrocon 2022 have certainly been nothing short of it! There’s **lots** to read about as we approach the 2-month mark to our convention.

### Anthrocon Block Party

We’re taking our public engagement with city of Pittsburgh one step further and testing out something new for 2022: the Anthrocon Block Party! You can find out more details about the event, along with a short promotional video on [our new page](/anthrocon-block-party).

### GOH Announcement: Sardyuon and Sokyokukokoh

We regret to announce that our performing GOH, Sardyuon, is not able to join us for Anthrocon 2022 due to unforeseen circumstances. We look forward to inviting him back for 2023, but we won’t be losing our special guest - his fellow furs from the Land of the Rising Sun, Sokyokukokoh and Hashita Kaoru, will still be in attendance and putting on a spectacular performance during our convention. Check out the new information on our [Guests of Honor page](/guests-of-honor)!

### Charity

- **Charity Donations:** Anthrocon is seeking item donations for the charity raffle and charity auction. We are looking for: furry themed art, items, and comics, new clothes or plushies, crafts, fursuits, figures, etc. Items should be new, like new, or well-kept. Find out more information on how you can donate on [our Charity page](/charity) - questions can be directed to [charity@anthrocon.org](mailto:charity@anthrocon.org).
- **Charity Staff Recruitment:** Charity is seeking several new staff members for the 2022 convention. We are looking for responsible and dedicated individuals who can help watch the charity tables and work with our charity representatives. Please reach out to [charity@anthrocon.org](mailto:charity@anthrocon.org) if interested.

### Conbook & Advertising Submissions

The final deadline for conbook submissions and advertisements is **May 1st**. To learn more about what kind of submissions are acceptable, head over to [our Conbook section](/conbook).

### Art Show

There's still space available in the Art Show for any artists who haven't already submitted a reservation! If you submitted an Art Show reservation for 2020, it's been rolled over to this year - if you haven't received an acknowledgment, check your spam email folder or any old/alternate email addresses you may have used when submitting the form in 2020, or simply submit a new reservation. Find out more information on [our Art Show page](https://www.anthrocon.org/artshow/artist-info)**. **Reservations will remain open until the space fills up.

### Programming & Fursuit Events

- **Panels:** Panel applicants should be hearing back soon regarding the status of their applications - make sure you check the email that you signed up with! Questions or concerns regarding panel status can be sent to [programming@anthrocon.org](mailto:programming@anthrocon.org)**.**
- **Masquerade & Stage Performances:** As a test for 2022, we are working on a new way of organizing our main stage performances for a better flow, as well as leaning into the Westin’s Ballroom to host additional performances. We hope this will allow us to showcase as many performers as possible. We will also be opening the Westin Ballroom for an open-mic show to help new performers get practice in front of live audiences.
- **Fursuit Headless Zones:** Due to ongoing concerns about COVID-19 and transmissibility of the virus through air circulation, we will not be having fans set up in our Fursuit Headless Zones this year. Additionally, we will be spacing out seating areas to help promote social distancing. We’ll aim to mitigate the heat by keeping Headless Zones cooler, and having more frequent water service.

### Fursuit Dance Competition & Floor Wars

Are you looking to sign up for Anthrocon’s most exciting dance events? Whether you’re in fursuit or not, we’re bringing our two most electrifying events back to Pittsburgh. Check out our detail pages for the [Fursuit Dance Competition](/dance-competition/) and [Floor Wars](/floor-wars).

### DJ Submissions

For all the talented DJs vying for a spot on Anthrocon’s nightly stage, applications will be available shortly. Keep your eyes out on the [@AnthroconDances Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AnthroconDances), as well as our Events section of the website!

### Volunteers

Anthrocon 2022 is actively looking for volunteers to help make our return as successful as possible. For those that are interested in volunteering, we now have our sign-up form available to fill out. Find out more information and sign up on [our Volunteers page](/volunteer)!

### Telegram announcement channel

For those that may recall our previous Telegram Announcement channel, we’re in the process of creating a new channel for our official Telegram announcements for 2022 and beyond. Once we’ve been able to finalize the new group, we’ll share the link out for everyone to join!
