# Our Organization

Anthrocon is a Pennsylvania-incorporated 501(c)(7) not-for-profit organization. The staff and volunteers who put on the event do so entirely on a volunteer basis, with the primary motivation being a mutual desire to foster the growth of the furry community. The organization is overseen by the Board of Directors, who help provide governance and direction on key functions and areas of the annual event.

## Mission Statement

The sole purpose of the organization is to operate a yearly convention in order to bring together devotees of anthropomorphics from near and far, in a relaxed social atmosphere where fans of all ages may feel welcome.

As a not-for-profit group, Anthrocon is dedicated to keeping its cost of attendance to a minimum. Only those funds necessary to support the operation of the convention and to make preparations for the following year's convention are retained.
