# Minors and age-related questions

{{< center >}}[General Age Questions](#) - [Minors Under 17](#) - [Minors Under 13](#){{< /center >}}

### I don't have a driver's license or any sort of photo ID because I'm young. How can I get in?

You will need SOME form of photo identification that lists your name and date of birth. Our recommendation is for a Passport. It serves as positive identification anywhere in the world and you can get one even if you are very young. A State ID is usually an available and inexpensive option; It is similar to a driver's license. Minimum ages vary by state; for PA the minimum age is 10.

If you cannot get government-issued ID in time, then you should bring as many pieces of identification as you can: birth certificate, a school ID (especially with photo), or any official documents or sources including Photograph, Name, and/or Date Of Birth. If you have any questions, you can [contact us ahead of time](/contact) and we can see what we can work out.

### My parents don't understand what Furries are (or have gotten a bad impression). How can I explain it to them?

There are two pages on this site that can help. The first is [What is Furry](/what-is-furry), and the second is [About Anthrocon](/about). Show these to your parents.

A lot of young folks take the wrong tactic when trying to explain Furry Fandom to their parents, in that they spend so much time concentrating on what our fandom is not that they wind up giving a very bad impression. Tell them instead what it is. If you have any questions, you can [contact us](/contact) - or better still, have your parents [email us](/contact). We'd be happy to explain to them what we are all about.

You can also show your parents some of our featured guests from past years, and use their works to explain the furry fandom’s inspirations and models:

- [Kevin And Kell, the World’s Longest Running Webcomic](http://www.kevinandkell.com)
- [Andy Runton, creator of the children-favorite Owly books](http://andyrunton.com)
- [James Gurney, creator of *Dinotopia* and *Color and Light*](http://jamesgurney.com)
- [Charlie Adler, prominent voice actor in film and television](https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Charlie-Adler/)
- [The San Diego Chicken, nationally-recognized mascot and performer](https://famouschicken.com/biography/)

### My parents do not want to let me attend by myself. Now what?

Why not ask your parents to come to the convention with you? The convention is attended by people of all ages, including those that your parents may be closely aligned to. These folks occasionally have get-togethers and other events for other parents of furries. If they worry that they might be bored at the convention, the Pittsburgh area has plenty of things to see and do. Most parents that attend the convention with their children end up having a great time, and even return in future years!

For Anthrocon 2024, a new option is being offered for children under 13 to attend with another parent or legal guardian as their chaperone. A specific Assignment of Responsibility form is required in addition to the Minor Consent form, which can be downloaded on our [Registration page](/registration#forms) under “Minor Forms”.

### My friends all think I am weird because I am a Furry. Am I?

If your friends or classmates think you’re weird because you have a fun hobby that allows you to be creative and express yourself, it shouldn’t really matter what they think as long as you’re happy and having a good time. Plus, there are plenty of furries all around the world who would be happy to be your friend and enjoy your “weirdness”!

### I am under 21 years of age. Can I reserve a hotel room?

Certain hotels that Anthrocon has specific agreements with may allow guests aged 18 years or older to check in. However, these must be rooms reserved through Anthrocon’s booking website (Orchid Events) in order to qualify for this particular concession. Not all hotels offered within Anthrocon’s room block offer this; please double check on the booking website (Orchid Events) for a hotel’s minimum age before you reserve.

If you book outside of Anthrocon’s block, the minimum age requirement is 21 years old.

### I am under 21 years of age. Can I drink alcohol in a private hotel room?

No. Pennsylvania State Law is very strict about underage drinking. If we learn of underage drinking, we are required by law to report it to the local authorities. If you are under 21 years old, please do not consume alcoholic beverages while at the convention.

### I AM between 13 TO 17 YEARS OLD. DO MY PARENTS HAVE TO ACCOMPANY ME AT THE CONVENTION, OR ATTEND THE CONVENTION?

From 13 to 17, minors may feel free to enjoy the convention on their own, with or without their parents, once the minor has their membership badge. We do recommend careful planning of meet times and contact plans if minors wish to spend extended time on their own. Parents are very welcome to purchase their own membership and attend Anthrocon, but do not need to.

### DO I NEED THE PERMISSION OF MY PARENTS TO ATTEND?

Yes. If you are under 18 years old at the time of the convention, you need permission from your parents or a legal guardian in order to attend. This rule is necessary due to unfortunate situations in years past.

Permission is obtained by downloading and printing out the Minor Consent form, which can be found on our [Registration page](/registration). Your parent or legal guardian must fill out the form, and then have it taken to a notary and signed in the notary's presence. The other way permission can be obtained is to have your parents come to Registration with you and fill out the parental consent form on site.

### I AM NOT YET 18, BUT I WILL BE 18 BEFORE OR DURING THE CONVENTION. DO I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I TURN 18 BEFORE I CAN REGISTER?

No, there's no need to wait. As long as you will turn 18 before the convention starts, you do not need to have your parents' permission - although if you live with them, we really do recommend you let them know where you will be. No use making them worry!

If your 18th birthday is during the convention, you must have the signed permission form and will be issued a minor badge. You may exchange your minor badge for an adult badge free of charge at Registration on your birthday.

### CAN AN OLDER BROTHER/UNCLE/FAMILY FRIEND SIGN FOR ME?

No. It must be your parents, or a person named by a legal court of law to be legally responsible for you.

### CAN I GET A HOTEL ROOM ON MY OWN?

No, you must be at least 18 years old to reserve a hotel room at select hotels within Anthrocon’s room block (21 years old everywhere else). If you will be staying overnight, we strongly recommend against making rooming arrangements with anyone that you do not know personally (and by that we mean face-to-face, not someone you met over the internet); better still, it should be someone that your parents have met and whose company they approve. Anthrocon prides itself on providing a safe environment, but we are a large gathering of people from all parts of the world, and one should be appropriately cautious. If you must room with newly met roommates, it is wise to make sure your parents have their complete contact information, have spoken with them, and have their trust.

### I AM AN EMANCIPATED MINOR. WHAT DO I DO ABOUT A PERMISSION FORM?

Emancipated minors need to bring court documents that prove their legal status. You will still be issued a Minor badge, but will not need any permission forms.

### I AM A MINOR FROM OUTSIDE THE USA, AND NOTARIZATION DOES NOT EXIST OR IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IN MY COUNTRY. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

[Contact us ahead of time](https://www.anthrocon.org/contact) and we'll discuss your options.

### I AM UNDER THE AGE OF 13. DO I NEED TO PAY TO ATTEND? DO MY PARENTS HAVE TO ACCOMPANY ME FOR THE ENTIRE CONVENTION?

Minors from ages birth to 12 do not need to pay for a Membership to the convention. They must be accompanied by their parent or legal guardian at all times, defined by us as remaining within a line of sight. The accompanying parent must purchase a convention membership.

### CAN AN OLDER BROTHER/UNCLE/FAMILY FRIEND ACCOMPANY ME?

For Anthrocon 2024, a new option is being offered for children under 13 to attend with another parent or legal guardian as their chaperone. A specific **Assignment of Minor Responsibility form** is required in addition to the Minor Consent form, which can be downloaded on our [Registration page](https://ac2018test.squarespace.com/registration#forms) under “Minor Forms”.
