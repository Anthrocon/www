## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< details "Do I need a sales tax license before the event?" >}}
Yes, you should [apply for your PA Sales Tax License](https://mypath.pa.gov/_/) or Transient Vendor Certificate as soon as practical. we'll ask for your license ID number in the application. Additionally, you'll need to show us a copy when you first sign in, to validate you have one available.

{{< details "Why the changes to the rules and processes?" >}}
We're constantly working to improve our event for our artists, attendees, vendors, and staff. Our #1 complaint for Alley has become centered around excessive numbers of merchandise vendors overflowing into Artists Alley. While we sincerely appreciate our vendors, Artists Alley needs to remain a place for artists to show and sell their art. We hope our updated rules and process will help with this issue.

{{< details "Where/when is check-in each day?" >}}
This information is to be determined as we plan out our point-of-entry and access control processes for 2025. Generally, check-in for lottery winners will be about an hour prior to opening to general attendees. Lottery winners will be notified of the exact details via email when the lottery results are provided. On-site sign-ups will be able to enter the exhibit hall via the normal attendee entrances.
