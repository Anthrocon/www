{{< center >}}# Anthrocon Art Show{{< /center >}}

On behalf of participating artists, Anthrocon’s Art Show exhibits and sells original artworks of a science fiction, fantasy and/or fannish nature, especially relating to anthropomorphics.

Artists offer works in various media, both flat (sketches, pen-and-ink drawings, paintings, etc.) and 3-dimensional (sculpture, masks, costumes, etc.) for display and sale. Artwork is sold by written bid, with a voice auction taking place Sunday for those pieces which receive enough written bids. We will also have a separate area for mature artwork, inaccessible to minors, with a separate voice auction Saturday night.

**If you are an artist,** the Art Show Reservations Information Packet (ASRIP) has all the details about participating in the Art Show. It is being reviewed and updated and will be available in February. There is a lot of information included, so please plan to allow yourself a few days to go over it and prepare your reservation. Start thinking now about how many pieces you wish to show, and how much room you'll need to display them.

Check back here in February when reservations open for a link to the packet and an online reservation form. To receive this information by postal mail, or to be notified by email when reservations open, please send your full (legal) name and postal address to <artshow@anthrocon.org>.

**If you are interested in purchasing artwork at the Art Show,** information for bidders will be available as the date of the convention approaches.

## Art Show Overview

### Areas of the Art Show

There are two distinct areas of the Art Show:

1. The “General Gallery” features original artwork depicting subjects suitable for all ages to view. This area will be open for silent (written) bidding during the day and early evening Friday and Saturday, and Sunday morning. If a piece receives enough written bids by noon Sunday, it will be sent to voice auction Sunday afternoon.
2. The “Mature Gallery” is for original artwork depicting mature subject matter. This area will be open during the same hours as the rest of the Art Show Friday and Saturday, and monitored to keep minors out. Pieces in this area which receive enough written bids by Saturday evening will be sent to a separate voice auction later that evening.

Since we provide artists the opportunity to get a Dealers Room table or a free table at Artist’s Alley, Anthrocon does not offer a print shop in the Art Show for the sale of multiple-copy items. Many artists make arrangements to sell their work through a service such as Etsy or Zazzle, which can make sales all year long instead of just at the con. Artists may still exhibit and sell single copies of prints to the highest bidder in the Art Show, as with original artwork.

### Types of Artworks

All entries of original art must be your own work. All entries of prints must be based on your own work. (This means that AI-generated works are not allowed.) You may enter collaborative works for which you contributed a significant effort, as long as you have permission from all other involved artists, and credit them accordingly. If a work is based on commercially-available patterns, designs, stencils, etc., this must be stated in the “medium” description on the bid sheet.

Artwork for sale should depict your own original characters, unless: (a.) you have written permission from the character’s owner, or (b.) the work is obviously a parody. Except for parodies, artwork depicting trademarked characters cannot be offered for sale because, as Anthrocon is the seller of record, we are not licensed to sell them. Works found to contain unauthorized depictions of others’ intellectual property may be removed from display or marked “Not For Sale” by the Art Show director upon request from rightsholders or their representatives.

All flat art should be matted and backed, framed, or otherwise mounted, ready to hang upon arrival. Framed works should have a wire for hanging, securely attached to the artwork. Glass mountings are not allowed. The idea is to protect the artwork and minimize the amount of fuss needed to display it. Contact the Art Show director if you have questions or an unusual situation.

If you have small works (flat or three-dimensional), we recommend you provide a case to hold the items, the better to safeguard them from damage or theft.

Prints are defined as mechanically-reproduced photoprints, serigraphs, lithographs, photocopies, laserprints, or other multiple-copy items. (Hand-colored lithographs are considered original art.) Only single copies of prints will be allowed in the Art Show. As mentioned above, we do not offer a print shop for the sale of multiple copies of prints.

Any item created using a computer or other method which can be used to produce multiple copies (e.g., screen printing) must be indicated as a print in the “medium” description on the bid sheet unless accompanied by a statement from the artist affirming that it is a unique work and that no further copies will be made.

### Display Space

The display unit for flat art (hung on the wall) is the wall space, 22 inches wide × 60 inches high (approximately 56cm wide × 152cm high). The display unit for 3-D art is the half-table, which is 3 feet long by 30 inches deep (approximately 90cm long by 75cm deep). You must specifically reserve space for each area in which you wish to display work: General Gallery and Mature Gallery.

Please note that our wall space units are smaller than the display panels used by many other cons. This is to avoid dealing with fractional reservations. Feel free to request two, three, or more wall spaces to get the amount of space you need.

When reserving your space, please keep in mind that you must allow space for mats, hanging hooks, adequate clearance, and for bid sheets around your pieces. Your artwork may not extend beyond the edge of the wall space or table, and it may not interfere with any works displayed by any other artist. One wall space will typically hold six 9” x 12” or A4-size (21cm x 29.7cm) matted pieces. Bid sheets are 4.25” wide x 5.5” high (10.8cm x 14cm, approximately A6-size). Allow 3” (8cm) above the top of each piece for clips and hooks.

Floor space for large free-standing artwork (e.g. sculptures, costumes on mannequins, works on easels or stands you bring, etc.) must be arranged with the Art Show director by the reservation deadline; please contact him and include all details about the piece(s) and supports (if any).

### Agents and Mail-In Service

If you cannot attend Anthrocon, you may be represented by an agent at the convention. An agent is simply someone you authorize to act on your behalf in dealing with the Art Show at the convention. They will bring, hang and pick up your artwork, do your paperwork, etc. — i.e., perform the normal duties and accept the responsibilities you would if you were present. Typically, an agent is an artist’s friend or acquaintance who is attending the convention anyway. One person can act as an agent for several artists. There is no set limit to the number of artists an agent can represent, but remember, it takes time to hang the art and do the paperwork: it could take several hours for several artists.

We no longer offer mail-in service. We feel it best to devote our efforts to the artists and agents who invest the time and expense to attend the convention.

### Fees and Commissions

Anthrocon is a registered not-for-profit organization, but we must collect a 15% commission on sales to cover the expenses of running the Art Show. (Neither Anthrocon nor its staff profit from this.) Those who paid for space in the Dealers Room receive a discount of 2.5 percentage points (i.e., a rate of 12.5%).

On a case-by-case basis, we may also pass along any expenses incurred in accommodating special requests. This may include such things as fees for electrical use, shipping expenses if you leave unsold artwork behind, etc.

Please be realistic in estimating how much space you’ll need. We may consider charging a hanging fee in an attempt to deter people from requesting a lot of space and then canceling shortly before the con, or giving back much of it at the con, or simply not showing up without telling us. Last year dozens of spaces ended up vacant which other artists might have reserved.

### Union Labor Issues

Any convention facility large enough to house Anthrocon has a unionized work force. We are quite fortunate that the unions who are contracted by the David L. Lawrence Convention Center are reasonable and have been willing to work with us on many issues. It is important that artists understand the issues that pertain to the Art Show:

In general, artists may hand-carry or use a non-motorized cart to bring in their artwork from the street level entrance to the convention center, or via the skybridge from The Westin hotel, or (for those who are dealers) from their dealer table in Halls A/B.

Anything that is large enough to require a forklift or motorized cart, or which must be assembled by more than one person, or which requires the use of power tools to assemble, will require the assistance of union labor, and the cost of this specialized service will be charged to the artist. Please contact the Art Show director at <artshow@anthrocon.org> before April 30 to arrange for this.

We understand that this may be something new to some of our artists. Please bear in mind that this is standard practice for large venues such as this one. Only those artists with large, heavy artwork are likely to be impacted by this.

It is important that Anthrocon maintain a strong and friendly working relationship with the local staff. If you have any disagreements or issues with any union or non-union convention center employee, please do not argue with them. Bring your disagreement to the Art Show director or to the chairman.
