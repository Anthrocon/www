Hi, and welcome to the 2010 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Event Followup!

Anthrocon raised a total of $12,849 for Fayette Friends of Animals, our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to Laura Wiand and all the volunteers from FFoA who came out to participate!

Importantly, gratitude goes to all the donors who contributed artwork and merchandise to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets. This is what makes the event go, so recognition of their philanthropy cannot be understated.

Big thanks are in order for the Dorsai Irregulars, whose final fursuit ear-tag raised a single-item bid of $1600! That is a record at Anthrocon's Charity Auction for the highest item sale we've ever recorded. Special thanks also go to the Westin, Omni, and DoubleTree who each generously offered up a four-night stay during Anthrocon 2011.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Jason "creature" Murdock, Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty, Steven "ToraCub" Sears, and Mark "Sage Jackal" Johns. My great appreciation also goes to Dr. Sam "Uncle Kage" Conway for his auctioneering talents which surely contributed to the new highest average auction sale price ever recorded at Anthrocon.

More thanks go to 2, the Ranting Gryphon, and again to Dr. Conway for generously contributing the proceeds of their Sunday benefit comedy show to the charity.

Some raffle items were not claimed on Sunday. Items with more than 10 tickets will be re-raffled next year.
