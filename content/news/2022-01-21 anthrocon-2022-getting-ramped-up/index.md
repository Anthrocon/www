We’re already three weeks into the new year, and things are steadily ramping up with our convention planning. There’s plenty to look forward to in the next couple weeks’ time - read on and find out more about what’s happening!

### Registration & COVID-19 Policy

Pre-registration is available for Anthrocon 2022, and you can head over to our [Registration page](/registration) for more information and to purchase your pre-registered badge at a cheaper price compared to at-the-door registration. Our 2022 convention is still operating under a [COVID-19 policy](/covidpolicy) which we have updated based on current information and guidance provided to us by health authorities. As we move closer to June, any updates to the policy will be announced publicly, and any questions and concerns about our policy can be directed to [anthrocon@anthrocon.org](mailto:anthrocon@anthrocon.org).

### Hotel Bookings

Our hotel bookings for Anthrocon 2022 will open with the following schedule (all times listed in Eastern):

- **Ultrasponsors:** January 26th at 11 AM to January 31st at 9 AM
- **Supersponsors:** January 31st at 11 AM to February 2nd at 9 AM
- **Main Block (General):** February 2nd at 11 AM

Find out more information about available partnered hotels on our [Hotels page](/hotel). Unfortunately, suites are no longer available for request as they’ve all been grabbed!

### Programming Submissions

Panels submissions are open for 2022 - even if you submitted a panel in 2020, we require all panelists to re-submit their desired events to ensure accuracy and up-to-date information. Learn more about our events and submitting a panel on our [Programming page](https://www.anthrocon.org/programming).

### Guests of Honor

Our [Guests of Honor page](/guests-of-honor) is now available to view, providing an introduction to each of our esteemed guests for Anthrocon 2022. Panels and events for our GoH’s will be released with the Programming schedule once it has been finalized.
