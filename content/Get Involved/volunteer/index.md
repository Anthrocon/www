**Are there requirements to be a volunteer/staff?**

You must have a valid convention registration and be at least 18 years old to volunteer at Anthrocon. We cannot accept any individual below the age of 18 for several reasons - however, if you are a minor and someone you are with over the age of 18 (such as a parent) would like to volunteer, they are more than welcome to.

For **staff roles**, there may be additional requirements before being accepted for a Staff role. Details will be provided to those that qualify.

## Incentives for volunteering

While we can’t pay our volunteers for their service, we can at least try to make your efforts worthwhile. You will be given a timesheet and a ribbon when you sign up, and as you work, we will ask you to keep track of your hours and return the timesheet to Room 309 of the convention center. The more you help us out, the more rewards you’ll get:

- **Six (6) hours during the convention**: We’ll give you a food or snack voucher.
- **Twelve (12) hours during the convention**: We will give you a free Anthrocon T-shirt.
- **Eighteen (18) hours**: We will give you a complimentary membership to Anthrocon next year.
