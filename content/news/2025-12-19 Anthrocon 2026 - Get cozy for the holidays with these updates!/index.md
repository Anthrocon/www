The winter season is filled with all sorts of creepy critters, but you might find some warmth and comfort knowing that it means a new year is almost here. That brings us even closer to Anthrocon 2026, and many openings that you’ll want to put on that advent calendar of yours!

## Registration

**Online pre-registration continues to be open** until June 26, 2026 **OR** if we reach our designated maximum capacity! While our higher tiers of membership such as Ultrasponsor and Supersponsor may be sold out due to high demand, we still have other tiers available so that you’re able to enjoy the convention and everything it offers. For more information and to register, check out [**our Registration page’s “How to Register” section**](/registration/#how-to-register).

## Hotel Accommodations

We know just how much everyone loves the hotel booking process for conventions (said no one ever), and we’re working to increase the available hotels in Pittsburgh so that everyone’s got a place to stay.

**Booking Dates**: 2026 booking dates for hotel blocks will be finalized closer to the new year, but attendees can expect a similar timing as last year. Higher-tier memberships will have advanced booking access to a certain number of rooms at our more preferred hotels, with the remainder of hotel rooms being a part of our general booking.

* Ultrasponsors: February 3, 2026
* Dealers: February 10, 2026
* Supersponsors: February 17, 2026
* Sponsors/Attending: February 24, 2026

More information about what you’ll need and what to expect for Hotels can be found on [**our Hotels page**](/hotel).

In addition, we’re working on adding transportation services for all official partnered hotels not in the direct vicinity of the convention center. While we continue to work on updating shuttle information for 2026, you can reference last year’s service as an example on [**our Shuttle Buses page**](/shuttle-buses).

\<h2\>Events, Panels, and Performances\</h2\>

Interested in hosting or performing at Anthrocon 2026? Our event and performance applications are now open and will remain open until March 2026\. Applications and details for interested panelists and performers can be found on [**our Events page**](/events-panels).

## River Cruises

River Cruises tickets are now available for 2026! You can find all the update pricing for tickets that set sail from Thursday to Sunday of the convention by going onto our Registration system and viewing the “Event Store”. For other details, visit the [**River Cruises page**](/anthrocon-river-cruises).

## Dealers and Artists

Dealers Room applications are now closed, and our Dealers team is hard at work reviewing hundreds of applications from dealers, vendors, and artists from all over the world! If you applied, you can expect to hear back about your acceptance or rejection by late January. Dealers Assistants will purchase their badge separately after a Dealer’s application is approved. The finalized Dealers Room list and map will be available to attendees closer to the convention, likely around May or June 2026\.

Our Artists Alley sign-ups for 2026 have not yet opened, but we plan to update and announce the process in the new year. If you’re unsure about whether to get an Artists Alley or apply as a Dealer, please read [**our rules for the Artists Alley**](/alley/#artists-information).

## Staff and volunteer opportunities

It’s no secret that as we grow, so does our need for motivated and passionate people to help us with that growth. We’ve got many openings and opportunities; from those handy with computers to those handy with boxes, we want you to join our rapidly-expanding team. If you’re willing to contribute your time before or at the convention, let us know by completing the Volunteering section in [**our Registration system**](https://reg.anthrocon.org/apply/volunteer) (you must create an account first)!

## Stay up to date with latest announcements

While many of us are getting ready to spend some much-deserved holiday time being warm and cozy (and especially away from the dark, murky woods!), we want to make sure you come into the new year with the latest information as soon as it’s available. Make sure to follow us on our official channels on BlueSky, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and our community channels such as the official Discord server for Anthrocon. You can find links to all those platforms on the bottom of our website pages!
