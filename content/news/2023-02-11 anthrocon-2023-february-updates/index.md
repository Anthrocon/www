## COVID-19 &amp;MASK POLICIES

Our most up-to-date Anthrocon 2023 COVID-19 and masking policies is available for viewing on the [**COVID-19 Policy page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/covid-policy-2023), although it is subject to changes and updates based on emerging data, as well as guidance, from government and health experts. All updates will be announced to attendees via our social media channels described above.

Our current mask policy is that proper masks (covering the nose and mouth) are required to be worn in specific high-density and high-contact areas of the convention center and hotels, including: Registration, Dealers Room, Artist’s Alley &amp;Con Store, Art Show, Gaming Rooms and all Panel and Event Rooms. All other areas of the convention space will be mask-optional, and we strongly recommend fursuiters wear an appropriate mask underneath their costume heads to ensure they are compliant with our policy and minimize the chances of spread.
