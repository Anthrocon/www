# General Questions

**Does Anthrocon provide wi-fi for its attendees?**

We have worked out a deal with the convention center’s internet provider to have discounted wi-fi available for purchase within the convention center space. Check out our [Wireless Internet Questions page](/wireless-internet) for more details.

**Do I need a visa to enter the United States?**

If you are coming from a country that participates in the [Visa Waiver Program](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/nonimmigrant/visitor/visa-waiver-program/), then no.

You can also [try the Visa Wizard](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wizard.html) on the State Department's website to find out what visa you may potentially require, based on your citizenship.

**What documentation do I need to cross the border?**

If you are flying in to the United States from any other country, you MUST have a valid passport for your country of nationality.

If you are driving into the United States from Canada or Mexico, or are coming in by boat from Bermuda, check the requirements at the [Department of Homeland Security website](https://www.dhs.gov/)[.](https://www.dhs.gov/)

**In my country I am of legal age even though I'm under 18. Am I still considered a minor in the USA?**

Yes. Sorry!

**Is Pittsburgh a safe city for an international traveler to visit?**

Pittsburgh is no less safe than any other large city worldwide. We also have the advantage of being located in the heart of the city's business district, an area where the local authorities are particularly eager to see that people behave themselves.

**What kind of payments does Anthrocon and the city of Pittsburgh accept?**

Anthrocon is transitioning into a cashless-based system, which means that most of Anthrocon’s main transaction areas (Registration, Art Show, and Con Store) will be primarily accepting card-based payments. The convention center is also cashless, and will only accept card payments. Most establishments around the city of Pittsburgh will take cash and major credit cards, such as Visa and Mastercard.

**Are foxes to blame for any shenanigans that happen?**

Yes, always.
