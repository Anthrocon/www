Anthrocon is pleased to announce that PEARL Parrot Rescue will be our beneficiary for 2019's charity efforts. The following is a summary from PEARL Parrot Rescue that summarizes their mission and efforts:

*The mission of PEARL is to provide quality education to current and potential parrot or bird owners. Unwanted or found parrots are accepted at Parrot Education Adoption Rehoming League, and in turn, are adopted to qualified applicants. We also assist in home-to-home adoptions for non-parrot pet birds. We are a foster-based rescue, located in the Pittsburgh PA area.*

PEARL Parrot Rescue will be at the Charity Auction and will have a table in the Dealers' Room where you can meet them and peruse information about their organization.

More information about PEARL Parrot Rescue can be found at their website, [pearlparrots.com](https://www.pearlparrots.com/). If you have any questions regarding PEARL Parrot Rescue, they can be reached at **info(at)pearlparrots.com**.
