{{< center >}}### PUP Membership (Ages 12 and under){{< /center >}}

{{< columns >}}
Children who are 12 years old and younger at the time of the convention can get into the convention for free. As such they do not need to register and do not get a convention badge. However, we do offer PUP badges for those who wish to get a convention badge for their 12 &amp; under child for a minimal $5 fee. Purchase of these badges is not required.

<--->

{{< center >}}**Pricing**{{< /center >}}

- PUP: $5
- PUP/Sponsor: $50

{{< center >}}**(On-site purchase only)**{{< /center >}}
{{< /columns >}}

***Please note that children 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult (18 years or older) at all times, whether they purchase a PUP badge or not. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or legal guardian, a signed and notarized “***[***Parental Assignment for Supervision of Minor Child***](#minor-forms)***” form must be completed and turned in at registration. PUP badges include the price for the child only. Membership for the parent/guardian will need to be purchased separately.***

{{< center >}}### Dealer and Dealer Assistant membership{{< /center >}}

A Dealer membership allows a member all the benefits of an Attending membership, as well as the ability to purchase a Dealer Table, and admission to the Artists &amp; Dealers Social on Friday night. Dealer+Sponsor and Dealer+Supersponsor memberships are also available, giving the benefits of Sponsor and Supersponsor levels to Dealers!

***Dealer Assistants will purchase their own badges separately.*** Dealer Registration for 2024 requires a passcode, which is available on [**our Dealers page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/dealers)**.** Without this passcode, you will be unable to apply for a Dealer Membership or Table.

***

{{< center >}}## Disclaimers for registration tiers{{< /center >}}

**\* Note for Sponsor, Supersponsor, and Ultrasponsor:** A portion of this membership constitutes  a donation to Anthrocon which, by law, is not tax-deductible and is not refundable if your registration is canceled. For more information, please see [**our refund policy**](/refundpolicy).

**\*\* Note for Advance Hotel Reservations:** The higher demand hotels (such as the Westin, Courtyard and the Drury) will have a number of rooms set aside for the general reservation opening. This is done to ensure that no hotel sells out completely before the general opening and to give all attendees a chance to reserve a room in the higher demand hotels. You may see a hotel sell out during the advanced reservation period but once again have rooms available during general reservations. For more information about available hotels, see [**our hotels page**](/hotel).

{{< center >}}## Frequently Asked Questions{{< /center >}}

{{< details "What ID do I need to bring to get my registration?" >}}
For all attendees aged 18 years and older, we require a government-issued photo ID so that we can make sure nobody other than you is trying to pick up your badge or register in your name. Anthrocon accepts the following as a single-form ID: USA or Canada Driver's License, USA or Canada State ID, USA Military ID, or a Passport.

For minor attendees aged 13-17 years old, we prefer to have a government-issued photo ID as well.  However, we do understand that not every minor (especially the younger ones) will have an ID. If you do not have any of the above, we still need something with your photo on it that will confirm your identity and your date of birth. Contact the Registration department at [**registration@anthrocon.org**](mailto:registration@anthrocon.org) registration@anthrocon.org if you are unsure or need assistance in determining alternate forms of acceptable ID.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I don't have an ID. What should I do?" >}}
There are multiple options for both adults and minors to get a state-issued photo ID. Please ensure that you have a valid form of ID to get your registration badge before the convention; if you need help, consult your state or province’s government services to see what options are available.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Can I upgrade my membership after I've paid for it?" >}}
Absolutely! All you need to do is click on the link that was emailed to you with your registration confirmation. It will take you to your registration summary, and you need only click "Sponsor" or "Supersponsor" at the top and then "Update My Info" at the bottom.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I am unable to stand in long lines. What can I do?" >}}
Anthrocon will have ADA lines that are available at registration for those who are unable to stand in line, for whatever reason.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I have paid for a membership but cannot attend. Can I get a refund or rollover to next year?" >}}
We understand that circumstances may arise that prevent you from attending our convention. Requests for refunds must be received before the close of pre-registration. Requests for rollovers must be received before the Monday prior to the convention. For more information please visit our [**refund policy page**](/refundpolicy).
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I'm buying a registration badge for my child. Do I need one myself?" >}}
If your child is between the ages of 13 to 17, they do not require accompaniment within the convention space as long as they have a valid Minor badge (which requires the completion of a [**Minor Consent form**](#minor-forms)). If you wish to accompany them, you will need to purchase a registration badge for yourself.

Please note that children 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult (18 years or older) at all times, whether they purchase a PUP badge or not. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or legal guardian a signed and notarized [**Parental Assignment for Supervision of Minor Child form**](#minor-forms) must be completed and turned in at registration. PUP badges include the price for the child only. Membership for the parent/guardian will need to be purchased separately.
