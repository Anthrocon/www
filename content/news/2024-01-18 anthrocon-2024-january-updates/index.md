We hope you’ve all had a great start to 2024 so far! As we continue to brace the cold winter weather and look forward to warmer times, we want to ensure you have all the important information related to the available hotels, booking process, and more - it’ll be a fast-paced start to this new year!

## Registration

- **Temporary pause**: In preparation for the opening of our Hotel block, online pre-registration will ***temporarily pause on January 30th and February 2nd*** at 11am Eastern Time. After February 2nd, online pre-registration will continue to remain open until June.
- **Membership levels**: Supersponsor and Ultrasponsor levels have already sold out and we have introduced a limit on the number of Sponsors that we are selling for 2024; if you’re waiting to book, you may not get the level that you want.
- **Updates to Standards of Conduct**: We have made some updates to our Standards of Conduct, which all membership holders of Anthrocon agree to follow. You can find the latest version on our [**Standards of Conduct page**](/standards-of-conduct).

## Hotels

We’ve updated all hotel information and rates for the 16 partnered hotels that will be available for Anthrocon 2024, and that we have secured a hotel block with specific discounts. You can view the different rates, room types, and more important information on our [**Hotel page**](/hotel) - the below points are only the latest updates.

- **Booking link**: Remember that the hotel booking links will ONLY be sent to the email that you registered for Anthrocon with. Rooms that are booked through other sources like a hotel’s website, a travel agency, calling in, or any other method will **NOT** be eligible for Anthrocon’s rates. We are also unable to assist with any reservations outside our block.
- **Booking dates**: Booking links will be sent at 11am Eastern Time on dates based on Registration level, as detailed on our [**Hotel page**](/hotel). This starts with ***Ultrasponsors*** on January 25th, ***Dealers*** on the 27th, ***Supersponsors*** on the 30th, and ***everyone else pre-registered*** on February 2nd.
- **Suites**: In previous years, suites have been offered through a different form process. This year, suites will be booked through the same booking link as standard rooms and follow the same booking dates as above, based on Registration level.
- **Backup option**: The hotel booking process is VERY fast and rooms at the nearby hotels typically sell out quickly. You may wish to consider a backup hotel option if you’re not able to book the room you want, as we will have our free shuttle service running between the convention center and all hotels. You can view an example of the shuttle routes on our [**At The Convention page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/at-the-convention#shuttle).
- **Deposits and Cancellations**: A one-night deposit is NOT required for booking a room, but a valid credit card is still required to reserve. Cancellations can be made without penalty until end-of-day May 16th, 2024 - a one-night rate and tax penalty will apply after that.

**Looking for rooms or roommates** for Anthrocon 2024? We **strongly advise** attendees to make sure that you:

- Verify any offer you receive, especially if it's someone you don't know.
- Use caution if an offer looks too good to be true - it might be!
- **NEVER** give out personal info, including payment, to someone you aren't comfortable with. If in doubt, you can always double-check someone’s details or if a room is legitimate.

## DEALERS, Artists Alley, Art Show

Dealers for Anthrocon 2024 have now been approved, and approved dealers have been contacted to confirm acceptance.

- **Billing for approved Dealers**: If you had indicated that you would provide specific communication/confirmation that the Dealers team can bill you, please do so as soon as possible. We require processing your Dealer fees before we can confirm your table placement, and allowing you to book in the Dealers hotel block.
- **Waitlist Dealers**: Dealers not yet accepted are automatically added to the waitlist in the event that a cancellation occurs; if you wish to be taken off this waitlist, you must inform the Dealers team by email.
- **Artists Alley**: As our Dealers coordination gets more manageable, we’ll be looking to open up our Artists Alley applications during the last week of January. These will be posted, along with updated documentation, to our [**Artists Alley page**](/alley).
- **Art Show**: The Anthrocon Art Show is tentatively scheduled to open for applications starting in the middle of February. We’ve got some major updates this year’s Art Show - stay tuned for more information, which will be shared through social media and on our [**Art Show page**](/artshow)!

## PANELS, EVENTS, AND PERFORMANCES

- **Panels and events**: Online applications for those that would like to host a panel or event at Anthrocon 2024 will be open until March 15th. Whether it’s bringing together a specific-interest group for a social or teaching furries a new skill, we’d love to expand upon the diversity of our events and panels. Learn more on our [**Events page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/events-panels).
- **Stage performances**: Looking to showcase your talents on one of our live stages? You’ll also apply through the same form as above. You can find all the information you need to know, along with the application link on our [**Events page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/events-panels)!

## VOLUNTEERING AND STAFFING

With our convention continuing to grow bigger and better each year, our team is also looking to grow in the same direction. From helping out in-person with crowd control and logistics to helping support and moderate our online community channels, we’d love to hear from you if you’re interested. It’s also a great way to gain practical experience in event running, get to know new friends, and give back to a great community. More information on opportunities and how to apply can be found on our [**Volunteer page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/volunteer).
