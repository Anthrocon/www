Hi, and welcome to the 2018 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Events Followup!

Anthrocon donated a new convention record of **$42,051** for South Hills Pet Rescue, our supported charity this year.  Thanks very much to all of South Hills' volunteers who came out to participate!

We also set new records for the charity raffle and the bucket brigade!

- More special thanks are in order to the following groups and individuals:To all the donors who contributed artwork, merchandise, and memorabilia to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets.
- To the Dorsai Irregulars, Anthrocon's security contingent, who contributed the New &amp; Improved Golden Ticket for 2019.
- To all the Sunday comedy show performers, for their charity performance from which all ticket sales were donated to charity.  Also, as always, to Dr. Conway for his annual auctioneering skills.
- To all the fursuiters who volunteered their time for the new &amp; improved fursuit "bucket brigade": Vira, Prince Mai, Hubcap, TehAlbi, Hella Obnoxious, Toxic, Foxkiller BlueDragon, Martog, Gadget, R3venge, Kodiac, Oliver Devlin, Tamaska Kitsune, Blue Mouse, Dusk &amp; Laguna, Kytezilla, Star, Tumult, Snorkyl Randa, A Loaf, Queenie Deerhart, Red, Wolven, Monster Bones, Cyfer, Whitepaw &amp; Scooter, Peach Pit, Lt. Knight, and Grandma Kage.  Congratulations to our top three fundraisers: Prince Mai, Tumult, and A Loaf!
- To all the attendees who bought merchandise and made cash donations to South Hills' donation buckets at their table.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd, Tracey "Stormy" Bealer, Karl "Xydexx" Jorgensen, Lynn Harris, and Sharon Yates, as well as the additional assistance of legacy staffer, Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty.

Unclaimed high-ticket raffle items will be re-raffled next year.

**RESULTS ARE CURRENTLY TENTATIVE** for a few months after publication of this summary to account for  additional incoming donations and human error.  Corrections will be made as they are identified.
