# Tips on Making Lines More Bearable

As part of the convention experience, particularly at larger ones like Anthrocon, you’ll likely standing in a long queue line at some point during the weekend – it’s inevitable when an event has that many people standing together each with the same goal (to register, enter the ballroom for a main event, etc.) and a finite number of hard-working volunteer staff.

So, when faced with a queue that rivals one at Disney’s Splash Mountain on a hot summer day, here are some tips to make it more, pardon the pun for our ursine friends, bearable:

- **Go to the bathroom first!** If you anticipate needing to stand in line for any length of time, you definitely want to take care of business beforehand. While the vast majority of furries are kind and will gladly hold your place in line should nature call, it’s a situation best avoided if at all possible, since the line could jump ahead enough that you’ll have trouble finding your original spot, and/or break into a different queue while you are away.
- **Bring a friend!** It’s amazing how having a friend or two in line with you will help pass the time, chatting about what your plans are for the weekend or even your favorite video games and TV shows. If you’re alone and see someone in the same boat, perhaps start a conversation by complimenting something about them (such as their clothing) and asking where they’re from. Not everyone will want to start idle chatter with a stranger, but if you’re going to spend the next 30-60 minutes next to someone, it wouldn’t hurt to make an acquaintance, and possibly a new friend!
- **Mobile devices are your friends, too!** Make sure your phone is fully charged and dive into your favorite app or mobile game. Do keep an eye on the queue as to not hold up the line, however.
- **People watching!** Queue lines, particularly the one heading into the main ballroom in the DLCC, are great for people watching if you enjoy that. Have your camera out and be ready to snap photos of fursuiters walking around (don’t forget to politely ask for a photo or hug!) As a fursuiter, many times I’ve interacted with people looking bored in long queue lines, to give them a little entertainment and a smile.

One final note – please be patient and respectful with the Anthrocon Staff directing traffic, and also when reaching the end of a long queue line. Everyone is doing their best with the available help each department has, and we understand long lines can be frustrating!
