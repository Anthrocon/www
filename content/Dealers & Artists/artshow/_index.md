{{< center >}}# Anthrocon Art Show{{< /center >}}

On behalf of participating artists, the Anthrocon Art Show exhibits and sells original artworks of a science fiction, fantasy and/or fannish nature, especially relating to anthropomorphics. It takes place on the third floor (river side) of the [David L. Lawrence Convention Center](http://www.pittsburghcc.com/), rooms 323-330.

Artists offer works in various media, both flat (sketches, pen-and-ink drawings, paintings, etc.) and 3-dimensional (sculpture, masks, costumes, etc.) for display and sale. Artwork is sold by written bid, with a voice auction taking place Sunday for those pieces which receive enough written bids. We will also have a separate area for mature artwork, inaccessible to minors, with a separate voice auction Saturday night.

## For Artists

**If you've submitted a reservation for display space:**

If you have never received any e-mail acknowledgment, please **contact the Art Show director immediately** by e-mail at [artshow@anthrocon.org](mailto:artshow@anthrocon.org) or by phone at 307-ARTYFUR (+1 307-278-9387).

If your reservation has been confirmed, you will be receiving a link to enter your artwork information online, and also (if you chose the option on the reservation form) paper forms and instructions in the mail. You can also download them below, in PDF format. **Important Note:** The Control Form is a 3-part, no-carbon-required form, which provides copies for you when you check-in and check-out. If you don't need copies for your records, you may print 1 copy from the PDF to give to us. If you do want copies for your records, print 3 copies, or obtain the 3-part form at the con. Bid Sheets are included in the big Con Forms file, but also available separately. In both files, the Bid Sheets are PDF forms -- you can type in the info about your pieces, and print! (**Mac users:** Sorry, some versions of Preview don't handle the form correctly. Please use Google Chrome if you experience difficulty.)

**If you have not already reserved display space:** It's too late to send in an advance reservation, but there is usually some leftover space available as artists discover they are unable to fill all the space they reserved. Artists without reservations may walk-in to claim leftover space at the con **after noon on Friday, July 5**. Please read the [Art Show Reservations Information Packet (ASRIP)](https://www.anthrocon.org/artshow/artist-info/), which includes the display rules and a link to the online reservation form. Submit your reservation info online to save time at the con. You may also download the Con Forms file above to familiarize yourself with the forms (or if you're really optimistic, to print and fill out your bid sheets -- but please understand there's **no guarantee** you'll be able to get any space, if enough others claim it all before you arrive).
