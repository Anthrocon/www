Hi, and welcome to the 2013 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Events Followup!

Anthrocon raised a **new record total of $31,255 for Equine Angels Rescue**, our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to Pam Vivirito, Annamaria Carrington, and all the volunteers from Equine Angels Rescue who came out to participate!

More special thanks are in order to the following groups and individuals:

- To all the donors who contributed artwork and merchandise to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets.
- To the Dorsai Irregulars, Anthrocon's security contingent, who contributed the last fursuit slapband, the Elevator Golden Ticket for 2014, and raised additional funds at the elevators.
- To Dr. Samuel Conway and 2, the Ranting Gryphon, for their charity performance for which all ticket sales were donated to charity. Also, again to Dr. Conway for his annual auctioneering skills.
- To all the fursuiters and their handlers who volunteered their time for fursuit "bucket brigade" duties.
- To the Westin, Omni, and DoubleTree who each generously offered up a four-night stay during Anthrocon 2014.
- To all the attendees who bought merchandise and made cash donations to Equine Angel Rescue's donations jar at their table, which is always a large percentage of the total funds raised.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty and Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd. Also thanks to the volunteers who were able to spare some time to assist.

Unclaimed low-ticket raffle items were donated to Equine Angels Rescue for their use. Unclaimed high-ticket raffle items will be re-raffled next year.

Results will be tentative for a month or two after publication of this summary to account for additional incoming donations and human error.
