Anthrocon is pleased to announce that [South Hills Pet Rescue](http://southhillspetrescue.org/) will be our beneficiary for 2018's charity efforts. The following is a summary from South Hills Pet Rescue that summarizes their mission and efforts:

_Nick Ferraro ran South Hills Pet Resort, a boarding and training facility, and purchased it in 2012. Ashley Rittle was having a hard time with her dog, and called Nick to request his training services. Little did they know the adventure ahead; they were married in June 2013, and that August, they were asked to help a local animal rescue that had been overwhelmed with dogs pulled from high-kill shelters set to be euthanized for behavioral issues. They agreed to take 13 dogs, but 62 dogs were dropped off at their door filling all of the Resort’s boarding kennels. Nick and Ashley cared for all 62 of these dogs in need, rehabilitating them before finding each dog a forever home. Ashley will tell you this is the moment they knew what they had to do. The plan was to dedicate ten of the Resort’s boarding kennels to dog rescue, but as we all know, plans often change._

_Today, South Hills Pet Rescue (SHPR), an independent 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, houses an average of 50 rescue dogs at all times. Apart from three part-time staff members who care for the dogs onsite, SHPR is run by volunteers. Your support of SHPR directly helps dogs in need!_

South Hills Pet Rescue will be at the Charity Auction and will have a table in the Dealers' Room where you can meet them and peruse information about their organization.
