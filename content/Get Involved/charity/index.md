{{< center >}}## 2024 Charity: Gray Paws Sanctuary{{< /center >}}

{{< center >}}***“To provide quality forever care to abandoned senior dogs”***{{< /center >}}

{{< img src="Gray+Paws+Logo+Sept+2014.jpg" float="left" hint="drawing" >}}

This year, we’re delighted to be partnering with [**Gray Paws Sanctuary**](https://graypaws.org), a Pittsburgh-based 501©3 non-profit, fully volunteer organization dedicated to rescuing senior dogs.

Most of the senior dogs rescued into sanctuary, or placed in Forever Foster Homes are from private owners in crisis. Gray Paws also sponsors dogs from local shelters, humane officers, animal control, and other partner rescues. Often times, dogs would be euthanized because of their age and veterinary care costs.

Gray Paws is committed to providing the best quality of life for senior dogs with high quality care. When the time comes, they provide palliative and hospice care. With the help of our dedicated veterinary partners, Gray Paws lets senior dogs go to the “Rainbow Bridge” when they have lived the fullest life possible. Gray Paws will be using donation money to expand their endeavors in rescuing and rehoming senior dogs and providing lifetime care for their rescues, as well as support veterinary bills for additional senior dogs.

At the convention, you may see some costumed performers going around with a specifically designated bucket for soliciting donations to the charity. It’s none other than our Bucket Brigade - and we’d love you to be a part of it.

The Anthrocon Charity Auction is an event on Sunday afternoon of the convention that offers items and products unique to the convention to bidders to raise money for a charity, chosen annually by the convention.
{{< /columns >}}

The Raffle has the same purpose, but is a ticket-driven event over Friday and Saturday that accepts non-unique items and merchandise, with all winning ticket numbers presented during Sunday's Dealers Room hours. Higher value donations are sold at the auction. Lower value items are raffled at the charity's Dealers Room table.

### How do I Bid in Anthrocon’s Live Charity Auction?

On Sunday of the convention, you’ll have the ability to participate as a bidder in the live Charity Auction for items that are specifically presented by our auctioneer. Check the schedule on the [**Events page**](/events-panels) closer to the convention dates for the exact time of the auction.

### How do I donate items to the Charity Auction?

Interested in donating to the Anthrocon Charity Auction or Raffle? Send an email to [**charity@anthrocon.org**](mailto:charity@anthrocon.org) stating what you are donating, your name, your preferred email address if it's different, and details on the donation (what is it, medium, artist/donor, etc.). This information is for approval purposes only - details should be provided with the required information card at the convention.

{{< details "Rules for donating items" >}}
If you are donating an item (artwork, sculpture, animation cel, etc), it must be G to PG rated (PG13- or R-rated items accepted only with prior permission). You may either bring it to Anthrocon if you are attending or you may send it via postal mail. Write to [**charity@anthrocon.org**](mailto:charity@anthrocon.org) to receive the address that postal mail items should be sent to. If delivered by mail, the item must include a 3x5 card with pertinent, legible information such as the donor, artist, medium, and any other important information a bidder or ticket-holder should know so that the item may be properly auctioned or raffled. If delivered at the convention, please do so at the charity's Dealers' Room table during Dealers' Room Setup hours on Friday. You will be required to fill out a 3x5 card with the aforementioned information for display and/or auction purposes. Items donated for the auction must be unique - they cannot be available anywhere else at the convention. And please: we appreciate your generosity, but do not donate multiple copies of the same item!

Additional information and more detailed rules can be found on the [**Charity Event Rules**](/charity-event-rules) page.

**An organization related to or associated with helping animals.**
