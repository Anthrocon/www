Due to the recent and ongoing issues caused by COVID-19, we are supplying an addendum to the Refund Policy for Anthrocon 2020.

- Deferrals from 2019: As stated in the refund policy a deferral was only good for the following year and could not be refunded or carried over to future years. For this year we will be waiving this limitation. If you have registered for 2020 using a deferral from 2019 and are unable to attend we will allow the deferral to transfer to Anthrocon 2021. This will be a one-time waiver of this policy and if the deferral is not used in 2021 it will be forfeit.

**At this point, there are no plans to cancel Anthrocon 2020 and preparations for the convention are moving forward as normal.** However, we are implementing the following options in regards to membership cancellations effective immediately:

1. **Donation of the membership costs to Anthrocon**
   1. The membership will be canceled and the funds donated to Anthrocon.
2. **Deferral of the membership until 2021 (Default Selection)**
   1. If the membership is deferred you will receive a coupon code once registration for Anthrocon 2021 opens.
   2. The coupon has no cash value. Once the membership is deferred refunds will no longer be issued.
   3. The deferred membership must be used for Anthrocon 2021. If you are unable to attend in 2021 the deferred membership will be forfeit.
3. **Partial Refund of the membership.**
   1. Due to our payment processor changing full refund policies because of many Covid-19 related refunds, we are asking our attendees if they're willing to cover refund costs. This is a small portion of the full refund amount (About 3-4%), but it would help Anthrocon to handle associated fees. Anthrocon will issue a full refund for all who wish.
   2. Request for a refund of the membership must be emailed to [refunds@anthrocon.org](mailto:refunds@anthrocon.org). The email must include the following information:
      1. First and last name of the registrant.
      2. Badge name
      3. Email used to register
4. **Full Refund of the membership.**
   1. Anthrocon will absorb the associated fees incurred by the refund.
   2. Request for a refund of the membership must be emailed to [refunds@anthrocon.org](mailto:refunds@anthrocon.org). The email must include the following information:
      1. First and last name of the registrant.
      2. Badge name
      3. Email used to register

Once an option is selected and implemented for a cancellation it cannot be changed or undone, all selections are final.

**The following policies will only be in force if the convention is canceled for 2020.**

When a registration is purchased for a person the registration becomes their property and they are the only ones who can request a refund. In order to expedite the cancellation process, **in the event Anthrocon 2020 gets canceled,** we will allow the purchaser of the registration to request the method of cancelation of the membership.

**In the event Anthrocon 2020 gets canceled** registrants to the convention will have 2 weeks from the announcement of the cancellation of Anthrocon 2020 to email us at [refunds@anthrocon.org](mailto:refunds@anthrocon.org) and select the method of cancellation. **If no email is received within the 2 weeks the membership will automatically be deferred until 2021 and can no longer be refunded.** If the convention is canceled it will be announced on our webpage at [www.anthrocon.org](https://www.anthrocon.org) and on all of our active social media platforms.
