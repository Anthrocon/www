# Travelling Internationally to Anthrocon

As someone who travels internationally every year to attend Anthrocon, and has helped many furries from other continents do the same, I’d like to share some considerations and best practices for making sure you get here smoothly and with as few hiccups as possible. ***Remember that these are just general guidelines*** and may not apply to same to everyone, depending on your situation. Consult your government’s travel directions or guidelines if you have specific concerns!

## Ensure Your Travel Documents Are Up to Date

Your number one priority when planning international travel is **making sure you’ve got a valid passport to travel**; after all, we wouldn’t want you to be stuck at the airport! In addition, depending on your country of origin, you may need additional documents such as a travel visa or other documentation in order to travel to the United States without restrictions. Please consult your local government office or embassy if you do not know what these are, as Anthrocon cannot provide advice or counsel on your situation. You can also start by checking the [United States government’s Visa Wizard](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wizard.html).

In addition to having your documents, you may need to **verify that your passport does not expire for at least 6 months.** For example, if your passport’s expiration date is August of the travelling year and you are travelling in June or July, you may need to check that you can still travel using that passport as it is within 6 months of expiry. Otherwise, you may be asked to renew it before travel, and will not be able to use that passport to enter the United States.

If you aren’t sure about your travel documents being valid for traveling to the United States, please consult your local government office or embassy.

## Payments and Foreign Currency

Most major credit card providers such as Visa and Mastercard are now widely accepted at all establishments and businesses, but if your credit card or contactless payment requires a “travel notice” to use internationally, make sure you contact your bank or credit provider to give them a travel notice so your card won’t be blocked. You’ll also want to make sure you have enough credit on the cards you want to use, especially if you plan to charge large transactions to it such as your hotel room.

Although most of the world has now transitioned to a card-based or cashless-based payment system, there’s still a lot of use for having good old-fashioned paper money in the event of an emergency, or when your payment device isn’t working properly. Even if you don’t like carrying cash around, we recommend going to your nearest banking institution or foreign exchange establishment and getting enough money to last you a couple of days in the city (check out our [Budgeting For A Furry Con guide](https://www.anthrocon.org/guides/budgeting-for-a-furry-con) for tips on how much money to bring). International airports will also have foreign currency exchanges if you need a little extra. It’s better to have it and not need it, than the other way around!

## Double Check Your Travel Arrangements

If you’re coming internationally, there’s a good chance that you’re flying here (unless you’ve developed some awesome swimming skills - looking at the aquatic furs!) on a commercial airplane. The closest international airport to fly into Pittsburgh is the Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). More details on how to get from the airport to the city and convention center can be found on our [Travel Tips page](https://www.anthrocon.org/travel-tips#flying).

If you’ve already booked your flight, make sure you learn about any other alternative options there might be in the event of delay, and what your airline’s delay or cancellation policies are. If you haven’t booked your flight, consider booking a flight that leaves earlier in the day so you’ve got other options to travel in the event of disruption - from personal experience, allowing for several hours in between connecting flights has always been a good call. You could also consider buying travel insurance which may give you additional peace of mind and protection should your travel plans go awry.

**Get to your departing airport at least 2 hours early for international flights** - this will help reduce the chance of you getting delayed at bag check, security, customs, and other areas. Delays and cancellations can happen all the way up to the last minute of your trip. Make sure you’re checking your reservation on a regular basis, even if you’ve already checked in and/or confirmed for seats, as things may change without notification. This is especially important if you have connecting flights on your way to Anthrocon, or back home - if one flight gets affected, chances are that you may need to reschedule your connecting flights as well.

## International / Roaming Phone Plans

If you plan on using your phone, ensure that you check your phone provider’s roaming or international plans. Some phone plans won’t need you to buy a separate roaming plan and will charge you a flat fee per day based on what partnerships they have with American phone services (such as AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile). However, these roaming plan charges can add up quickly which could put a bigger dent in your budget. Make sure you spend some time researching what options you’ll have for using your phone in another country, and if you need to add any roaming options before leaving.

If you aren’t planning to use a roaming phone plan, you may be able to get a pre-paid SIM card at the airport before you leave, or once you arrive in America at the airport or select stores. If you don’t feel like doing that, you’ll still be able to use publicly-available wireless connections (wi-fi) around the city and in establishments such as hotels or restaurants. If you’re staying in a hotel, you’ll likely have free wi-fi as part of your stay. The convention center also offers paid wi-fi within the building while you roam around.

## Tipping Practices in North America

A very unique and fascinating experience I’ve encountered in my international travels is that “tipping”, or giving a gratuity to a service worker, varies greatly between countries and continents. In America, a tip or gratuity is generally expected at any establishment that has table service for food and/or drinks, such as a restaurant. In North America, the **minimum** we would recommend tipping is 15% of the total bill - for example, if your bill comes to $15 after taxes, you would leave a tip of $2.25. However, if you received great service or the food was above your expectations, you can tip more. Note that in some restaurants, having a large group of people may automatically apply a gratuity fee, which counts as the tip.

If you’re staying in a hotel, leaving a tip for your housekeeper each day is also a good practice. A general rule of thumb is to leave at least one dollar per person staying in the room, or for each towel/linen that you need changed every day. If your housekeeper provides additional services for you, such as helping you take out a lot of trash or bringing you extra towels or linens, consider giving a more generous tip to thank them for their hard work.

Remember that not only is tipping an expected practice in Pittsburgh, but it also shows that our community appreciates the hardworking citizens of Pittsburgh, and that we want them to keep welcoming us back to their city.

## Learn the Language, Culture, and the Area

This might seem like a given, but it’s a helpful recommendation that I practice and share with others whenever traveling abroad. If English is not your first language, or it’s been a while since you’ve practiced it, there’s always room for improvement so you’re not stuck wondering how to ask for directions to the Dealers Room. Furries are an international crowd and there’s bound to be many at the convention that speak your primary language, but it never hurts to know the basics such as asking for directions. If you have a smartphone with a translator tool, such as Google Translate, it’d be beneficial to ensure you’ve got the necessary languages downloaded to the app.

Pittsburgh is a beautiful city to sightsee, and you may find yourself wandering the local streets and establishments at some point during the convention. We recommend familiarizing yourself with what’s around the convention center so you’re always aware of where you are, and how to get back. This is where learning how to read wayfinding signs and directions come in handy. You can also check out our [Fursuiting Opportunities and Places At Anthrocon guide](https://www.anthrocon.org/guides/fursuiting-opportunities-and-activites-in-pittsburgh) for some suggestions on places to see, even without a fursuit.
