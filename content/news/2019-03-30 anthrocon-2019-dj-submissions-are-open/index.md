Hi everyone! I'm Veyote, and I'm pleased to announce that Anthrocon 2019 DJ submissions are now open!

Protocollie and I are now a joint team, and our mission is to make the nightly dances at AC bigger and better than they've ever been. Every night, AC’s AV team & tech crew dims the lights in the Spirit of Pittsburgh Ballroom, and some of the fandom’s greatest DJs hit the stage. If you think you're up for it, read on!

We strive ourselves on booking as many popular and requested genres as possible. While the usual mainstays like house, dubstep, future bass and other EDM genres are expected to fill the later slots, we want to try to make as many people happy and cater the dances to everyone.

Having said this, we are in particular need of HIP-HOP & POP DJs. These two genres are heavily requested from us, and we have not been able to fill slots with them as we’d like to. Not because we don't like them, but we do not get submissions for them!

For the submissions themselves, please keep them to around 60 minutes long, and please submit what style you plan on playing if selected! The last day to submit your audition will be **Sunday May 19th**, with selections going out by the first week of June. You've got plenty of time to pull something new together if you'd like, but don't delay too much! We can't wait to hear what you've got.

Here’s the form! [https://veyote.typeform.com/to/gu7VmS](https://veyote.typeform.com/to/gu7VmS)

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to or DM [@AnthroconDances](https://twitter.com/anthrocondances) on Twitter. We can't wait to hear what you've got.
