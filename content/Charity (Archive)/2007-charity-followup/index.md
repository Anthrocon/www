Hi, and welcome to the 2007 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Auction Followup!

We raised a total of $5,053 for Animal Friends, our charity this year. They also benefited from donations at their Dealers' Room table to the tune of $1,528.

I'd like to give my sincere thanks to my staff members who assisted me throughout the days the Charity items were displayed and during the Auction itself. These indispensable people who I rely on year after year to support the event are Jason "creature" Murdock, Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Steven "Tora" Sears, Lincoln "JBadger" Kliman, Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty, Jesse "Tango" Stringer, and Matt "Danruk" Adey. Extra special thanks to Dr. Sam "Kagemushi" Conway and the Dorsai for auctioneering the full stretch.

Also, a big note of gratitude to Tim Susman and Redlynx for the wonderful art that graced the souvenir mugs that each donor received. Based on the demand for them after the convention, they're already collector's items.
