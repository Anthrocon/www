It’s getting chilly in the deep waters of Anthrocon’s voyage of the deep seas as we navigate towards the end of the year. While you’re getting warm and cozy for the holiday season, take a couple minutes to see what’s happening with 2025’s event.

## Registration

Online registration is open for the 2025 convention, which you’ll need in order to book an Anthrocon 2025 hotel block room through our official partner link (provided to pre-registered members). Please note that our higher level memberships are sold out at this time, but cancellations may occur from time to time.

We’re also continuing to strategize and plan for a faster and smoother pre-registration pick-up experience at the con itself — we’re no fans of long lines, either. For more information about registration accommodations and other related questions, check out the FAQ on our [Registration page]({{< relref "/Registration/registration" >}}).

## Dealers and Artists

Applications for the 2025 Dealers Room have closed, and our staff are well underway with reviewing and sending out acceptance emails to accepted dealers (rejection notices will be sent afterwards). Once accepted, payment will be required for your Dealership to be approved and completed. Dealers Assistants will purchase their badge separately after the Dealer application is approved. The [Dealers Room Information Packet]({{< relref "/Dealers & Artists/drip" >}}) will contain the latest information and rules for 2025.

Details for the [Art Show]({{< relref "/Dealers & Artists/artshow" >}}) and [Artists Alley]({{< relref "/Dealers & Artists/alley" >}}) will be updated and shared starting in 2025, including any important changes to rules or policies once finalized.

## Events, Panels, Stages Performances, and DJs

- **Events and Panels:** If you’re interested in hosting something at Anthrocon, from socials and meet ‘n greets to special group events, we’d love to hear from you. Read about the details of hosting an event, and find the link to apply on our [Events page](https://www.anthrocon.org/events-panels/#apply-to-host-an-event).
- **Stage Performances:** Got a musical set or performance art to show off? Applications to perform on Anthrocon’s stage are now open. Read more and find our application form on our [Stage Performances page]({{< relref "/Events/stage-performances" >}}).
- **Nightly Dance DJ applications:** Think you’ve got what it takes to turn our Nightly Dances into a massive party? DJ applications are currently open, and will continue to remain open until the DJ team has determined they have received enough. Find out more and apply on our [Nightly Dances page]({{< relref "/Events/nightly-dances" >}}).

## River Cruises

We’ve finalized our offerings for 2025’s River Cruises, and will be making updates to the River Cruises page to reflect the updated timings and ticket pricing. Tickets will be available in January 2025, with further announcements to come on social media that will confirm the exact date and time. You’ll be able to see the changes reflected soon on our [River Cruises page]({{< relref "/Events/anthrocon-river-cruises" >}}).

## Hotel Booking

We know you’re itching to find out when hotel bookings will be available, and we’re happy to share some more details about our plan for 2025.

**Warning about scams:** We have received some reports of people receiving fraudulent emails claiming to have Anthrocon-block hotel rooms. These should be treated as scam attempts, as you can only book through the official link that will be emailed to registered attendees and available through our Registration portal.

**Booking Dates:** This year, we will be revising the staggered booking approach to allow for more time between tiers, and more opportunity to triage and address any issues found in earlier blocks. The current planned booking dates for membership groups and Dealers are:

1. **Ultrasponsors:** February 4th, 2025 at 12 PM Eastern Time
2. **Dealers:** February 11th, 2025 at 12 PM Eastern Time
3. **Supersponsors:** February 21st, 2025 at 12 PM Eastern Time
4. **General (everyone):** February 28th, 2025 at 12 PM Eastern Time

Each of the openings above will have rooms available at every hotel to ensure that there is a chance for each group, but we do ask for the fandom’s understanding as there are many more attendees than there are rooms at our most popular hotels. Similar to our registration system, we’re taking steps to improve the process of the hotel booking experience to ensure that it is as smooth as possible given the massive demand.

**Hotel Shuttles:** We are taking steps to improve the availability and accessibility of our hotel shuttle service for 2025, and are happy to announce that all buses for 2025 will have increased capacity and are wheelchair-friendly. This is another big change that we hope will continue to serve the wider attendee base, and we’re excited to see how it helps get attendees to and from the convention center faster.

## Staff and volunteer opportunities

It’s no secret that as we grow, so does our need for motivated and passionate people to help us with that growth. If you want to be part of a passionate team of volunteers and staff, you can apply on our new Registration system through the “Volunteering” option in the menu. Once you fill out the form, our Volunteering team will be in touch with you about any potential matches!

For more examples and details about being a volunteer, visit our [Volunteer page]({{< relref "/Get Involved/volunteer" >}}).
