Packing for a furry convention can be like trying to navigate a complicated shopping list. Did you remember to pick up the water bottles? How many bars of soap do you really need? No matter how many times you think you’ve packed, there’s always a chance you could be missing something. Here’s a few helpful things to consider - consider it our handy packing guide!

### General packing for a furry con

- **Clothes**: remember that it’s summertime in Pittsburgh, and you’re more than likely to sweat during the day. Bring enough changes of clothes for each day, especially undergarments, and some spare clothing in case you need a mid-day change from all the excitement.
- **Toiletries**: your toothbrush and toothpaste, shower products, and other things to help you stay clean and fresh throughout the convention. Make sure you’ve got enough for the whole stay, although your hotel also provides basic toiletries like soap and shampoo if you run out.
- **Deodorant**: I’m calling this one out specifically because not only is it the summer, but you’ll be running around the convention center and working up a sweat - even if you’re not in fursuit. A little bit of deodorant goes a very long way, and everyone will appreciate it!
- **Comfortable shoes**: conventions are a fantastic workout, but are pretty hard on your feet. Pack your most comfortable, long-distance shoes if possible or get some in-soles to help with the long convention days. Your feet will thank you!
- **Money or payment cards**: you’ll want to make sure you’ve got all your payment options, whether it’s cold hard cash or credit cards, and that they’re usable while you’re in Pittsburgh. Remember that Anthrocon is transitioning to a cashless-first system, meaning that most areas of the convention will only take card-based payments. If you don’t know how much you should bring, check out our guide on [**Budgeting for a Furry Con**](/guides/budgeting-for-a-furry-con).
- **Medication and vitamin boosters**: if you regularly take medication, make sure you have them in an easy-to-find place and pack a little extra just in case. Other medications such as painkillers are a good tip for general illness. If you haven’t considered packing vitamin boosters, such as Vitamin C supplements, they’re a great way to ensure you stay healthy and energized throughout the con.
- **Device chargers and power bars**: your phone and/or camera will get a pretty good workout each day, and you won’t want to be caught with no charger. This applies for anything you have that runs on a battery. If you’re coming from an international country, don’t forget to pack a travel adapter. In addition, if you’ve got a lot of roommates or devices to plug in, a power bar or strip is very handy.
- **Stuff for artwork/merchandise**: if you’re planning on hauling some awesome artwork or merchandise back home, you’ll want to bring a bag or suitcase that can hold it. If you’re planning on getting some art commissions, don’t forget your sketchbook(s) either!
- **Reuseable water bottle**: staying hydrated is important in the summer, and even moreso at a furry convention. A reuseable water bottle will help keep you hydrated and cool, and there are plenty of water stations around the convention to refill with.

### Packing as a fursuiter

If you’re bringing a fursuit, regardless whether a full costume or partial, you’ll want to make sure you’ve got everything you need to keep it clean and in good condition for the whole weekend.

- **Fursuit parts, props, and accessories**: It seems pretty obvious but from personal experience, you might forget to pack things as trivial as your hands or feet during the rush. Make sure you’ve got everything to go with your fursuit so you look your best!
- **Cooling and/or under-gear**: most fursuiters use some form of “under-skin” or “heat gear” that helps keep them cool and reduce perspiration getting onto the fursuit. You can find these under-skins or “heat gear” at most stores that sell sporting equipment. If you have room, bringing a small fan helps immensely!
- **Cleaning kit**: make sure you’ve got enough cleaning material, whether you use disinfectant spray or isopropyl alcohol, and a brush to help smoothen out that soft fur so you can keep giving great hugs all weekend.
- **Repair kit**: although we hope it doesn’t happen, accidents can happen and require repairs. A small sowing kit and a glue gun, or super glue can help mend common repairs such as fabric holes and loose claws.

### Packing as a dealer or artist

As if there weren’t already things to stress about when preparing to sell at a convention, artists and dealers probably don’t want to stress over forgetting something at home! Keep these tips in mind (courtesy of Moth Monarch and Catmonkshiro):

- **Display parts and hanging supplies**: missing a piece of your display, or your entire display, would make displaying your wares quite tough - make sure you pack all the parts needed for your display or table. Bringing extra clips, zip ties and tape for hanging/securing things is always a good idea.
- **Extra art/craft supplies**: bringing extra supplies such as paper or cardstock has it’s uses, such as if one of your signs gets damaged, or you’re doing at-convention art commissions. Related materials like badge clips and lamination sheets are important, too.
- **Signage and promotional materials**: whether you’ve got your table banners, pricing signs, flyers or business cards, you’ll want to have plenty of these things on hand. With potentially thousands of customers passing your table, make sure they remember who you are.
- **Supplies to make your table stay easier**: things like utensils to eat at your table, even if you're bringing snacks, can save some headaches of eating at your table. In addition, a light jacket even though it's summer because the dealer's room can get chillier than you think during the day when you're seated at your table for extended periods!

If you forget anything while you’re actually at your table, ask your fellow neighbors in the room. They’re likely to help you as long as you ask nicely! You could also research local office or supply stores in the area, just in case.

### Other things to pack

- If you’re coming from abroad, don’t forget to pack your travel documents (such as a passport) and any other documentation you need to enter the country. For more details on coming internationally, check out our article on [**Travelling Internationally to Anthrocon**](/guides/travelling-internationally-to-anthrocon).
- If you’re running an event or panel, don’t forget to pack things you’ll need to host the panel. Remember that Anthrocon doesn’t provide everything for panelists - find out what Anthrocon’s Events team does and does not provide on the [**Events page**](/events-panels).
