Anthrocon is pleased to announce that [Wildlife Works Inc.](https://www.wildlifeworksinc.org/) will be our beneficiary for 2020's charity efforts. The following is a summary from Wildlife Works Inc. that summarizes their mission and efforts:

Wildlife Works Inc. is a volunteer-based non-profit organization serving Westmoreland and surrounding counties, dedicated to the rehabilitation and release of distressed native wildlife and the promotion of responsible attitudes about the preservation of native species, habitat and the environment.

Wildlife Works rehabilitates small mammals, songbirds, waterfowl, reptiles and amphibians, and birds of prey who have been victims of human interference, environmental contamination, and habitat destruction.&nbsp;Because people and their activities are often responsible, directly or indirectly, we believe we have an obligation to help these wildlings.

Wildlife Works is a state and federally licensed wildlife rehabilitation center located in Youngwood, PA with several small satellite centers that help with species of special concern.&nbsp;We are the largest facility in Westmoreland County, and the only one equipped to accept all species of raptors, including Bald and Golden eagles.  Beth Shoaf, our Executive Director, and Senior Rehabilitator hold current PA State and US Fish and Wildlife Rehab and Education permits.&nbsp;Beth has been rehabbing professionally since 1991.

Wildlife Works is a 501(c)3 charitable organization. &nbsp;We are not federally or locally funded and exist solely on donations and community support.&nbsp;Volunteers donate hundreds of hours assisting in animal care, fundraising and outreach.  Together, we believe we can have a positive impact on individual animal lives as well as teach future generations to learn to respect and co-exist with our wild neighbors.

Dedicated to the care and release of injured, ill, and orphaned wildlife.
