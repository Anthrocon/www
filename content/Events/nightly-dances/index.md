**What rating is the nightly dance?**

The nightly dance is rated as an all-ages event. Please be aware that this is an event catered to adults and features a dark environment, loud music, bright strobing lighting and visual effects, and fog/haze effects. Attendees should always exercise caution when enjoying our dances.

**Applying to DJ for the dances**

* DJs will be compensated with free registration for Anthrocon.
  * If you've already pre-registered, you will be refunded.
* By applying to perform, you agree to abide by [the Performer Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncm9i0UvAYuXLp4U1FtyLN0A4jpL_RwetOlAikHdm_0/edit?usp=sharing):
  * The convention is staffed by human beings (or very convincing animals) who work very hard to make your show go well. Be respectful of the staff and other attendees at all times.
  * Alcoholic beverages are not permitted on any stage at the convention.
  * We often must establish restrictions regarding who is allowed on stage for safety reasons. Please be respectful of those rules during your performance and check with staff before inviting anyone on with you.
  * We understand that musical self-expression can sometimes include coarse language and mature content. We don’t have specific rules against this, but ask that you don’t take advantage of that fact for shock value. Most performances (including the dances) at Anthrocon are all-ages - use your best judgment.
  * Be on time for sound checks. If the crew does not have enough time to prepare for your show, we reserve the right to strike it from the line-up.

{{< center >}}## Frequently Asked Questions{{< /center >}}

**What is the clothing policy/rating at the nightly dances?**

We strive to balance creating a place of self-expression and creativity for our attendees, while also keeping in mind public decorum and our convention’s general rating. Please be mindful of this guideline - if our staff or security team finds that an article of clothing or accessory is inappropriate, we will ask you to leave the dance and come back after changing/removing it.

**What kinds of music/genre/style is played at the nightly dances?**

A variety of music genres are chosen for each night of the dances. You can expect to see the line-up (to be announced closer to convention) populated with some of the following examples:

- Pop (and Pop-remixes)
- Hip-Hop/Breakbeats
- Trap and Dubstep
- House
- Trance
- Drum & Bass

**Are the nightly dances livestreamed?**

Yes, we plan to have an official livestream on the Anthrocon channel for the in-person Main Event. Further details will be announced and posted to our website.

**Will we have coyotes invading and causing mayhem at some point?**

Probably.
