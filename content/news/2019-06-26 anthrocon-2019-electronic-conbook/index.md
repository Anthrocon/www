For Anthrocon 2019, we are trying something new and have decided to make our conbook available for download!

Note that there will still be physical conbooks available onsite, but this electronic copy can be downloaded to your phone or laptop and be read in advance of the con.

The conbook can be browsed below, [or downloaded from this link](https://www.scribd.com/document/414664301/Anthrocon-2019-Conbook).
