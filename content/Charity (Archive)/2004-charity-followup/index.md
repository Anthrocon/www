Hi, and welcome to the 2004 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Auction Followup!

We raised a very satisfactory total of $6100 for our charity this year, Forgotten Felines and Fidos. Caroline Lease, their charity representative, sent us the following message of thanks:

> "Please share with the members of your organization how thrilled that Forgotten Felines and Fidos was to attend your recent convention! We had a great time and met some wonderful, caring people. "We would like to thank Anthrocon for their support and generosity! Over the weekend, over $6,000.00 in auction/donation funds were received for our shelter. Please know that this will go a long way to providing medical care, shelter, and food for the many, many stray animals that enter our facility."
>
> "We were honored to have been selected by your organization and applaud your continued efforts of supporting local animal groups."

This year's auction was also very special because Anthrocon's Charity Auction work was nominated for the Time Warner Andrew Heiskell Community Service award which recognizes volunteer service done in the community. This is the first time the fandom's charity work has been recognized in this manner. In acknowledgement, AOL is donating $100 to Forgotten Felines and Fidos, as well.

With Anthrocon's success this year, we wanted to give extra thanks to Forgotten Felines & Fidos for helping us make 2004 our best ever, so Anthrocon has donated an additional $1000 to support their beneficial work with animals in our community. We wish them all the best!

I'd like to give my sincere thanks to my staffmembers who assisted me throughout the days the Charity items were displayed and during the Auction itself. These indispensable people who I rely on year after year to support the event are J. Scotty "Windsinger" Emerle, Jason "creature" Murdock, Erika Leigh "Chillymouse" Rosengarten, Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Derek "ZenWolph" Sailor, and Lincoln "JBadger" Kliman. Extra special thanks to Sam "Kagemushi" Conway and Ryan "Tet Solfire" Dewalt for auctioneering the full three hour stretch. Also thanks to Triggur, Simba_Lion and the entire A/V crew for their support in sound, lighting, and getting those photos of each item up on the big screen!
