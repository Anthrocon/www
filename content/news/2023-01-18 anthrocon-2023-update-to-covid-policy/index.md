Anthrocon has heard the concerns of our members and staff, and in response, will be posting the convention COVID policy details and guidelines in the coming week. While we work on finalizing the details, our policy will address vaccination and masking requirements and procedures. We will incorporate local guidance into the policy, with updates as needed, closer to the convention date. We sincerely apologize for any concerns or confusion to our membership regarding this topic.

The policy is being formalized, but we can share that we will require:

- Masking in densely congregated areas (e.g. Dealerâ€™s Den, Main Ballroom, etc.)
- Proof of vaccination/negative test prior to convention

Due to current surges and changing situations, we will provide more details as the convention approaches.

If you have any further questions, please send us an email at **info@anthrocon.org.**
