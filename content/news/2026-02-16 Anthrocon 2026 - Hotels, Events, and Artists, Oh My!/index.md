Now that the polar vortex has started to let up (or has it?), we can almost feel mysterious figures start to emerge from a deep hibernation. Maybe it’s a sign of the darker seasons ending - or maybe they’ve just begun for our cryptids. But more likely, it’s a sign that Anthrocon 2026 is getting even closer! Find out what’s opening and closing soon for applications and everything else you may want to know about.

## Registration

Online pre-registration will be **paused temporarily between February 20 and 24** to help support our General hotel block opening on February 24 (more information in the next section). After the opening, pre-registration will resume until June 26, 2026 **OR** if we reach our designated maximum capacity! While our higher tiers of membership such as Ultrasponsor and Supersponsor may be sold out due to high demand, we still have other tiers available so that you’re able to enjoy the convention and everything it offers. For more information and to register, check out [**our Registration page’s “How to Register” section**](https://www.anthrocon.org/registration/#how-to-register).

## Hotel Accommodations

We’re already into our hotel booking month for official Anthrocon hotel blocks, but as a reminder, you can find the opening dates for all hotel blocks below (based on Registration type). More information about the process, hotel options and additional tips can be found on [**our Hotels page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/hotel/).

* Ultrasponsors: February 3, 2026
* Dealers: February 10, 2026
* Supersponsors: February 17, 2026
* Sponsors/Attending (General): February 24, 2026

No matter where you might end up staying during the con, we’re working to improve our courtesy transportation service for Anthrocon attendees. While we work on updating shuttle information for 2026, you can reference last year’s service as an example on [**our Shuttle Buses page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/shuttle-buses/).


## Dealers Room and Artists Alley

Our Dealers Room applications have now all been processed! All accepted Dealers have been contacted at this point, meaning that those that have not been contacted with an acceptance will not be joining us as a Dealer for 2026. Our Dealers Map and updated information will be available once assignments and layouts are finalized closer to summer 2026.

Our Artists Alley rules and process for 2026 is now available on our site! The Artists Alley is a great way for budding artists to showcase their talents and artistic wares. The sign ups for the Artists Alley are a lottery, meaning that results are randomized and will be different for each day it’s open. Learn about the latest updates for 2026 and how to apply on [**our Artists Alley page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/alley/)!

## Events, Panels, and Performances

There’s only about a month left for our event and performance applications - if you’ve ever wanted to try your hand at sharing a subject or event that you’re passionate about, or bringing your talents onto one of our stages, applications will remain open until early March 2026. Details and form links can be found on [**our Events page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/events-panels/) and [**our Stage Performances page**](https://www.anthrocon.org/stage-performances/).

## River Cruises

River Cruises tickets are still available for 2026! Whether you’re looking for awesome photo opportunities or want to enjoy beautiful sunset on the river, these cruises are a hot attraction for Anthrocon attendees. You can find all the update pricing for tickets that set sail from Thursday to Sunday of the convention by going onto our Registration system and viewing the “Event Store”. For other details, visit the [**River Cruises page**](https://update-reg-details-2026.anthrocon.pages.dev/anthrocon-river-cruises/).

## Staff and volunteer opportunities

Even in a dark and spooky forest, a convention like Anthrocon shines the brightest when people step up and help it run smoothly. Every aspect of our event is run by volunteers of different levels; whether you’ve got the most. If you’re willing to contribute your time before or at the convention, let us know by completing the Volunteering section in [**our Registration system**](https://reg.anthrocon.org/apply/volunteer) (you must create an account first)!

## Stay up to date with latest announcements

While many of us are getting ready to spend some much-deserved holiday time being warm and cozy (and especially away from the dark, murky woods!), we want to make sure you come into the new year with the latest information as soon as it’s available. Make sure to follow us on our official channels on BlueSky, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and our community channels such as the official Discord server for Anthrocon. You can find links to all those platforms on the bottom of our website pages!
