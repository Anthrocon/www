Hi, and welcome to the 2015 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Events Followup!

Anthrocon raised a new record total of $35,910 for The Western PA Humane Society, our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to Sarah Shively and all their volunteers who came out to participate!

We also set new records for money raised in the Raffle and the Bucket Brigade!

More special thanks are in order to the following groups and individuals:

- To all the donors who contributed artwork, merchandise, and memorabilia to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets.
- To the Dorsai Irregulars, Anthrocon's security contingent, who contributed the Elevator Golden Ticket for 2016 and raised additional funds at the elevators.
- To Dr. Samuel Conway and 2, the Ranting Gryphon, for their charity performance for which all ticket sales were donated to charity. Also, again to Dr. Conway for his annual auctioneering skills.
- To all the fursuiters who volunteered their time for fursuit "bucket brigade" duties, with special thanks to Winter Skywere who shouted himself hoarse around the Dealers Room for hours and hours raising bucket money - an above and beyond effort!
- To the Westin, Omni, DoubleTree, and the Courtyard, who each generously offered up a four-night stay during Anthrocon 2016.
- To all the attendees who bought merchandise and made cash donations to the Western PA Humane Society's donations box at their table, which is always a large percentage of the total funds raised.
- To the generosity of attendees at our Closing Ceremonies, who donated more than $1000 on their way out the door.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd, Tracey "Stormy" Bealer, and Tamarie "CelticKitty" Simmons.

Unclaimed high-ticket raffle items will be re-raffled next year.

Results will be tentative for a month or two after publication of this summary to account for additional incoming donations and human error.
