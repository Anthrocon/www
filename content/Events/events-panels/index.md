## Anthrocon Event Policies and Rules

Please read the following information carefully and if there are any questions do not hesitate to send us an email.

**All event requests must be processed through our submission forms. This places your request into the queue to make sure that a member of the Events Team will see your request. Any request received via direct email, Telegram, Discord, text message, etc. will not be answered. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in helping us better serve you, the community, and the convention.**

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

In submitting my panel request for Anthrocon 2025 I accept and acknowledge the following:

1. Submission does not guarantee acceptance.
2. Equipment requests are not guaranteed.
3. Decisions regarding acceptance or denial of panel requests are made by Events Senior Staff - any appeals will be handled directly by the Events Director. All decisions by the Events Director are final.
4. If multiple submissions are received for the same event we will do our best to put you in touch with each other so you can work together if you so desire - if you can’t work together we will work from there.
5. You will abide by the Convention [Standards of Conduct](https://anthrocon.org/standards-of-conduct).
6. You will adhere to all Convention Policies Regarding Public Health.
7. Any host found to be charging an admissions fee or cover charge will have their event shutdown and be barred from hosting future events with Anthrocon.\*\*
8. An event may not pass out any food or drink, store bought or homemade. This includes but is not limited to coffee, tea, soda, chips, pretzels, candy, etc.
9. Panelists may not alter a room’s fundamental layout. If a room is set up as a classroom the tables must stay put; If it is set up as a lecture hall you may not move the chairs into a circle, etc. (Seating may be moved for accessibility or accommodation of additional panelists, but it must be returned to position at the end of your panel).

\*\* *If your event has an equipment cost, such as an event where you make something with the attendees, please contact the Events Director ([events@anthrocon.org](mailto:events@anthrocon.org)).*

**Finally - for your own benefit:**

- A single host may not participate in more than 5 panels during the convention. We love that you want to help but we want you to have fun.

### FOR 18+ panels (Adult rating)

Any panel that is identified as adult material or may be viewed as inappropriate for minors by either the panelists during the panel application or by the Events Senior Staff during review will be marked as 18+. All panelists for 18+ panels must be 18 years of age or older by the first day of the convention, there will be no exceptions and this cannot be appealed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< details "Do I need an Anthrocon registration to host an event?" >}}
Yes, a valid Anthrocon membership is required to be able to host an event at the convention. We do not provide complimentary membership for panel hosts, but do show our appreciation with other rewards!
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Why don't you have more events involving other special topics/interests?" >}}
Anthrocon strives to provide a variety of programming events so that there is something for everyone. Our programming space is limited and we have only so many hours in the weekend; if we were cater too strongly to one particular programming track, we would have to take programming space away from other tracks. If you have ideas for events you’d like to see, please send your feedback to [events@anthrocon.org](mailto:events@anthrocon.org).
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Can I submit an event for my own private function or party?" >}}
Again, sorry, but no. Anthrocon needs all of its programming space. Even space that may appear to be unused is often needed for setup or for overflow from other events. We are also responsible for what happens in our programming space and cannot offer it to attendees without formal approval and planning.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Is wireless internet provided for event hosts?" >}}
No, wireless internet is not provided by the Events Team nor Anthrocon. If your event requires internet access, be prepared to provide it yourself either through a paid service (such as the convention center’s paid wi-fi), or your own device (mobile hotspot).
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I'm a minor, can I host my own event or panel?" >}}
If you are a minor, you must be at least 16 years of age to apply to run your own panel or event.
