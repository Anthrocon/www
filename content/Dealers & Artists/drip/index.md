## Types and Sizes of Tables

**Standard tables:** These are located in rows, in groups of three or five with exit gaps to either end of the group. Other dealers will be beside you and in a row directly behind you. Half tables are only available in the Bodega area of the Dealers Room. All Standard table rows include a 2’8” center aisle for easier egress in case of emergencies.

| Table Size | Space (Total) | Space (Tables Only) | Space (Behind) | Chairs Provided |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Bodega (Half) | 38sqft | 4’x30” (2’6”) | 4’x7’ | 1 |
| Single | 76sqft | 8’x30” (2’6”) | 8’x7’ | 2 |
| Double | 152sqft | 16’x30” ( 2’6”) | 16’x7’ | 4 |
| Triple | 228sqft | 24x30” ( 2’6”) | 24’x7’ | 6 |
| Quad | 304sqft | 32x’30” ( 2’6”) | 32’x7’ | 8 |
| Quint | 380sqft | 40’x30” ( 2’6”) | 40’x7’ | 10 |

**Endcap tables:** These are identical to Standard tables, except they are located on the end of a row. They may be purchased in Single, Double, or Quad sizes.

| Table Size | Space (Tables Only) | Space (Behind)\* | Chairs Provided |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Single | 8’x30” | 8’6”x6’ | 2 |
| Double | 16x30” | 21’x6’ | 4 |
| Quad | 2 sections 8’x30”<br>1 section 16’x30” | approx. 15’x21’ | 8 |

\* Quad dealerships should maintain access to the nearest egress, and if necessary may move their side tables to do so. Changes should be presented to the Dealers Room Staff for approval in advance.

**Electrical power is NOT included with Standard or Endcap tables; it must be purchased from the convention center.** Electricity can be purchased via an online form that will be sent to approved dealers. Purchase of electricity can be made all the way until Friday morning before the Dealers Room opens to attendees, but rates increase 15 business days before the first day of the convention.

**Booths:** There are three booth types available at Anthrocon, Small, Large and Tattoo booths. All booths are bound by two or three sides by pipe and drape. All the space within your booth may be used. Tattoo booths have a shared back space for storing supplies, stencil printers and for privacy in case a tattoo client needs a break. This is a shared space surrounded by pipe and drape and should not be used as part of your personal dealer booth. Tables and chairs are provided, though you can bring your own tables or remove them entirely. Every booth comes with a 20A 3-outlet circuit for your use at no additional charge. Tattoo booths require submitting a Bloodborne Pathogen certification as well as proof of liability insurance to Anthrocon before the event.

**\*NEW FOR 2026\*** Islands are also available this year. Islands are not neighboring any other tables or booths and have all four sides clear. They do not come with any pipe and drape, though some may be requested for an extra charge if you wish. As with other booths, all the space within your area may be used. Tables and chairs are provided, though you can bring your own tables or remove them entirely. Islands also come with a 20A 3-outlet circuit for your use at no additional charge.

| Booth Size | Space | Tables included | Chairs Provided |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Single | 16'x16' | 4 | 8 |
| Large | 20'x24' | 6 | 12 |
| Tattoo | 12'x10' | 1 | 2 |
| Island | 25'x25' | 8 | 12 |

**No Dealership may encroach on aisle space, other dealerships, safety gaps, the center aisle, or any indicated walking paths. This includes placement of merchandise, signage, seating, or storage, as well as gaps adjoining Endcap tables; these gaps may not be adjusted without the approval of staff.**

Tables and chairs may be removed from your area at your discretion; place them in front of your dealership during Setup and a Teamster will remove them. Tables can be moved and rearranged anywhere within your allotted space. Relocating or removing a Bodega table requires the full agreement of both Dealerships using the table.

Extra tables added to your space will require the purchase of at least a Double Table, payment of a surcharge, and advance communication with the Dealers Room Staff. We cannot place additional chairs at your dealership due to space constraints and fire code restrictions/

If the requested table size is not available, you may be offered a smaller alternative option if you’ve indicated you’d be willing to take one on your application. However, dealers cannot “upgrade” to a larger space before the convention. We recommend applying for the amount of space you need.

## Applying for a Dealers Table

Applications will open on **October 27, 2025**, and will close on **November 17, 2025**.

Registration can be accessed at https://reg.anthrocon.org.

Fill out your application completely and carefully. Date of receiving the application will have no bearing on acceptance, so no need to rush. Dealer Assistants do not need to register until their Dealership is approved. Dealers should apply once and only once. Multiple applications, even if different, will not be considered and will result in all applications being discarded.

Dealership Table prices do not include an attendee membership, but a membership of any level must be purchased with every table.

The Dealers Room Staff will review your submission and begin approvals as promptly as possible, generally in January 2026. We may ask you for more information before we can approve your Dealership. You’ll be emailed about approval, denial, or waitlisting; there may be multiple rounds of approvals before notification of denial or waitlisting in order to efficiently handle matters. Please note that status in the ConCat system does not always indicate approval or denial as approvals are often entered into the system in stages.

Dealership applications will be approved based on a juried curation process. Curation will be performed principally by the Anthrocon Dealers Room staff, although other Anthrocon staff may be involved. Dealerships will be chosen based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:

**Relevancy:** Generally, items offered by dealerships should be related to the furry fandom or have a broad appeal to attendees and be of a good quality. Applications should be aimed more at furry conventions over other types of convention. Merchandise should be of a good quality that will interest attendees.

**Originality and Uniqueness:** Merchandise designed, created or manufactured by the dealership itself; original characters over fan works and the variety of the merchandise itself will all be taken into consideration. Dealerships selling unique items that fill a niche few others do may also be taken into consideration.

**Other:** Prior behavior at Anthrocon such as treatment of Anthrocon Staff, DLCC staff, fellow dealers and attendees; adherence to Dealer Room rules and other interaction will be considered during curation. Prior status as a Guest of Honor or Charitable organization will also be taken into account.

**Incomplete applications will not be considered until all required information is provided.**

**General application guidelines:** **Avoid linking to any sites or galleries that require a log in (locked FA, Twitter). Linking to a website or page with merch/art samples and table setup photo is best practice. Avoid Google Docs or Discord links if possible as they do expire. An online store or a dedicated application page, such as Carrd, is highly recommended for applications.

Dealers staff can not provide individual feedback on applications due to the volume of applications received.

**You must have a Pennsylvania sales tax license to sell any taxable items at Anthrocon, no exceptions.**

All dealers are required to collect and report a state tax of 6% and an Allegheny county tax of 1% on all sales of taxable goods, for a total sales tax of 7%. Clothing that is “Ordinary or everyday wear” such as T-shirts, hats, hoodies, etc. are not taxed; but ornamental, sportswear, formal, fur, and/or costume clothes (including fursuits and fursuit parts) are taxable. If there is a question as to whether an item is going to be taxable, please contact the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue or visit their website at https://www.revenue.pa.gov/.

Your payment for a Dealership at Anthrocon includes all applicable taxes and fees. Memberships, including Dealer and Dealer Assistant Memberships, are not taxed.

We have created a brief guide to obtaining a PA tax ID through the MyPath system, which can be found here:

{{< center >}}{{< button href="tax-guide" >}}Pennsylvania Tax ID Application Guide{{< /button >}}{{< /center >}}

We are required as the Promoter to have all license numbers on file prior to the convention, and due to past abuses we can no longer hold onto tables while dealers seek tax license numbers. That means that you must have a valid tax license before you can submit an application for a Dealership. **You must submit it with your application, or it will not be considered.** If you do not sell anything requiring sales tax, please note “Tax ID not required” on your application. Staff will verify your merchandise is exempt before moving to curation. If you applied for a tax ID but have not received your number, you can enter “Pending” under the ID field but your application will not enter the curation system until you email us the ID number. This can cause delays and may result in missing rounds of curation, so please send it to us as soon as possible. Applications noting that a tax ID will be applied for if the dealership is approved will not be considered due to delays in obtaining IDs after acceptance as a dealer.

You must report your sales tax license number to us each year with your application; Anthrocon is not responsible for maintaining this information, and it is not kept on-file from year to year.

In Pennsylvania, it is illegal for multiple businesses (ie dealerships) to share a single tax license. A table and associated assigned space represents “one Dealership.” It is staffed by one Dealer, and optionally one or more Dealer Assistants who are there to help the dealer in operating the dealership. A single tax license is required for each Dealership.

A “Dealer Assistant” (DA) is a person who helps a Dealer with tasks. If the primary interest of a person at the table is to sell their own merchandise, even though they may be helping you to sell yours, that person does not constitute a “Dealer Assistant.”

**Under no circumstances may two different dealerships at different tables share one tax license.** If you wish to share a table with another dealer, you must purchase two table spaces, one for each of you. Do not purchase a table with the intent to share it with someone else.

We understand that some dealers wish to share a table with others and are worried that they will be unable to if they submit separate applications. Anthrocon will make every reasonable effort to keep friends and business partners together, you may submit seating requests after approval. Please make sure that both you and your friend are requesting compatible table types.

Dealerships can be studios or partnerships as well. Any Dealerships that are in a studio system must make clear on their application that the works are coming from a studio system that operates as a united business, with one tax license and one cashbox. There must be one lead Dealer.

“Guests” at your table(s) are not permitted unless their merchandise is in some way directly related to the registered dealership, and they may not handle payments.

You are allowed to sell work on behalf of another artist or company if that work is included in your application and made clear when applying that you will be selling items on their behalf. This allows for Wholesale purchase and sales of another’s work or selling on consignment.

No table space may be shared with, exchanged, sublet, or resold to another Dealer without the prior consent of Anthrocon’s Dealers Room Director. This will require at minimum a completed dealer room application for both parties and advance arrangement with the Dealers Room Director before consideration. Any unauthorized sharing may result in revocation of dealer space or removal from consideration for space in future years.

Applications can be for either the General room or the 18+ Section, but not both. Dealerships with two separate DBA or business fronts may apply for each section as a separate business. Adult merchandise, with some exceptions, may be sold in both areas providing it adheres to our rules on displays.

### Types of Memberships: Dealers and Dealer Assistants

#### Dealers

The Dealer is the lead person for the Dealership. In almost all cases, they will be the owner of the business and the person who holds the Pennsylvania Tax License; they will be directly responsible for the Dealership, and they will be the final authority for communication with Dealers Room Staff, convention staff, or Convention Center staff. Every Dealership must have one and only one Dealer, and a Dealer can belong to only one Dealership.

There are occasions where a business owner must have someone else operate the Dealership at Anthrocon; this physically present person should be assigned as the Dealer so that Anthrocon has an immediate point of contract at the convention.

Dealers may purchase any level of membership desired from Attending to Ultrasponsor. You may also upgrade your Membership at any time before the close of Pre-registration by logging into your registration account at https://reg.anthrocon.org.

#### Dealer Assistants

A Dealer Assistant (DA) is an assistant to a Dealer, serving as part of their Dealership, with most of the same access and sales privileges as a Dealer. Assistant status is particularly important during setup and breakdown, as only Dealers and Assistants are permitted in the Dealers Room during those hours. Dealerships may have multiple Assistants based on the size of their Table and their needs. Each Assistant must be assigned to one and only one Dealership, though DAs are permitted to aid other Dealerships.

Any registered attendee may assist a dealer with sales while the dealer’s room is open to all attendees if dealers need assistance with breaks, as long as there are only two people behind each physical table for fire code (ie, one person for a bodega space, two for a single, four for a double, etc).

Dealer assistants can be designated by the dealer through their application in the registration system after purchasing a membership. DA memberships may also be Attending, Sponsors, Supersponsors or Ultrasponsors. DA Memberships must be purchased separately, and no Dealer Assistant Memberships are included in Table costs.

**Dealers in The Bodega (Half Tables) are not allowed Dealer Assistants due to the limited space afforded to their dealership.**

| Size | Single | Double | Triple | Quad | Quint | Small Booth | Large Booth | Tattoo Booth | Island |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Max DAs | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 2 | 8 |

## Waitlist, Table Placement and Cancellations

Once all tables in the Dealers Room have been assigned or suitable space is not available, any remaining applications will either be placed on the Waitlist or Declined. We will inform you if you have been placed on the waitlist once it has been determined. It is entirely possible that some Dealers may be told of their approval before other dealers are told of their Waitlist status, as curation and assignments are done in groups. We will not deliberately oversell the Dealers Room.

We will process the Waitlist based on the same curated criteria. Let us know you are willing to accept a different table type than your requested one. When listing minimum table sizes you would be willing to take, do not take a table that your set up or merchandise will not fit in. There will be no option to “upgrade” to a larger table size once you have accepted a space.

Once a table comes open, we will email the next Dealer on the waitlist that has a matching table type. There will be a limited time for response, generally a week to 14 days. Once the Dealer indicates their willingness to purchase a table, the Dealership will be approved and the payment will be required via the registration portal. **There is no need to email the Dealers Room staff about table openings; they will notify you when a table is available, and they will not be able to tell your position on the waitlist.**

If you find that you will not need or cannot use any or all of your Dealership space, please inform us as soon as possible. The earlier we know, the easier it will be for a replacement Dealer to make travel plans for Anthrocon. It is against Anthrocon’s policy to transfer an unwanted table to another person to bypass the waiting list.

Once payment is complete and your dealership is confirmed, seating requests can be made directly in the registration system. You are able to request a neighboring table with another approved dealer directly from your application. Both dealers must approve the seating request for it to be considered. Please do not add neighbor requests to other text boxes in your application or they may be missed. You are able to request to be away from dealers by product type (ie, not near soap vendors due to smell sensitivities) or make other special requests (ie, near the bathroom) via the special requests box. Please understand that if you have made many requests or very precise requests, we may not be able to accommodate them all specifically, and will do our best to meet as many as possible within reason. Do not request specific rows or room area placements as those will not be considered. Please let us know if you need a placement for accessibility or health reasons.

All Half-tables will be grouped together in “The Bodega”, an area designed to help new, growing, or small-format Dealers who have outgrown the Artists Alley stand out. Tables in The Bodega are considered the same as any other Dealer Table, and those Dealers have the same privileges and options as any other Dealer.

Once determined, we will email you with your table placement. We must note that table placements are not final until the convention, and within the first month after assignment, there may be changes. If you would prefer a different location after placement, please request one promptly and we’ll make an effort to re-seat you. Due to the complications of seating 300+ Dealerships, we cannot always grant placement requests.

Alternatively, if a situation requires adjusting your assignment, we will contact you to request permission. If at all possible, no re-assignments will be done without the approval of all Dealers involved.

In the unlikely event there is a conflict of placement at the convention, Dealers Room Staff will determine any placement adjustments.

Table or Memberships cancellations should be directed to both <dealers@anthrocon.org> and <refunds@anthrocon.org>. If canceling a table, please mention explicitly whether you wish to cancel just your Dealer table or both your table fees and registration.

Full refunds will be given for 2026 tables that are canceled on or before April 30, 2026. No refunds will be given for tables canceled after this date!

Full refunds will be given for 2026 Memberships that are canceled on or before June 12, 2026. No refunds will be given for memberships canceled after this date! Neither Memberships nor Dealerships can be ‘rolled over’ to the next year’s convention, and ‘vouchers’ are no longer provided.

### On Site Table Sales

There are occasionally last-minute cancellations that cannot be dealt with before the close of pre-registration. Anthrocon will offer these tables to appropriate new potential Dealers or as upgrade options for Dealers seeking a larger table. Dealers must still have a Pennsylvania tax ID and follow the same rules as any other dealer. These tables will be available on Thursday of the convention. To purchase an on site table, a prospective dealer needs to sign up at the Dealers Room registration table between 12pm and 1pm (or starting when dealers registration opens if registration opens early). At 1pm, Dealers Room staff will be conducting a lottery of anyone who has applied for a table to fill any open tables. At 1:15, the lottery results will be available and anyone who wishes to purchase an on site table can check to see if they’ve received one. Dealers who entered the lottery must arrive to claim and purchase their table before 2pm or their spot will be released and given to the next person in the lottery.

Any table that is left unclaimed as of 6 PM on the Friday of convention will be offered to appropriate potential Dealers, unless the owner of the table contacts us prior to that time and provides a reason for the delay in arriving. If you know you will be late or are unable to attend at the last minute, please contact Dealer Staff by email or other means as soon as possible. To purchase an unclaimed table, please see the Dealers Room staff table at 5:45pm Friday.

## Guidelines on Merchandise

Items and services offered in the Anthrocon Dealers Room should be related to the anthropomorphic theme of the convention or should have a broad appeal to furries and others in attendance at Anthrocon. While we do not exclude any sort of merchandise or services, those more “on-brand” with Anthrocon will be given preference.

Items generated wholly or partially by Artificial Intelligence based tools are not permitted for sale in the Dealers Room. Selling AI generated works is grounds for removal from the room, including reselling any artwork. Selling items, such as 3D printed object, that were made using AI may still result in removal from the convention, even if the person selling was not aware they were made using AI. Dealers are responsible for verifying any works they are displaying or selling.

Items and services that are illegal to possess or sell in the United States, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or City of Pittsburgh are equally prohibited in the Dealers Room. Items and services that require a specific permit or license to display or sell will require the Dealer to present the license. Notably, this includes CBD products, tobacco, lotteries, and raffles. Items or services which may be hazardous will require the Dealer to carry their own insurance; if we determine this is necessary, the Dealers Staff will reach out for a copy of your Certificate of Insurance.

Any item that is prohibited for direct sale is also not permitted for display, giveaway, or delivery during or after the convention unless otherwise specified.

The responsibility to ensure proper copyright of merchandise rests with Dealerships. Anthrocon recommends Dealers research and be aware of the legality of copyrights, trademarks, works of parody, and fan art. Artwork or merchandise that is known to be counterfeit is prohibited.

Depiction of minors, real or fictional, in adult situations is strictly prohibited, either on display or for sale; such items may also not be kept out of sight but available. This rule applies to both the general Dealers Room and the 18+ Section.

Items of a racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful nature will not be permitted for sale in the Dealers Room. This includes paraphernalia related to certain groups or political movements, or items intended to agitate and provoke.

Non-firearm weapons such as swords are acceptable provided the item is blunted and that the purchases are fully wrapped afterward. Anthrocon safety policy requires that these items not be waved, pointed, or otherwise brandished in public. Any items which resemble firearms but are non-firing must also be fully wrapped and not brandished. Customers who purchase such items should be encouraged to carry them directly to their hotel rooms or vehicles.

Items of a distinctly adult or sexual nature whose primary purpose is functional rather than artistic are prohibited for direct sale in all areas of the Dealers Room, including the 18+ Section. However, the 18+ Section permits display of samples and models of functional adult items, and for these items to be sold for delivery off-site. As Anthrocon encourages public health and safety, sale or giveaway of prophylactics such as condoms is permitted.

Tattoos may not be offered in the dealers room anywhere outside of tattoo booths for hygiene reasons. Tattoos should not be done on areas requiring censorship and clients must remain fully clothed. Hotels expressly forbid tattooing inside their rooms.

Our contract with the DLCC does not permit food and drink sales, displays, and giveaways in the Dealers Room without express approval from the Director and Levy Catering. If you would like to sell any food or beverages, you will need to reach out ahead of the convention and at minimum need to provide insurance.

No items may be produced or sold that bear the name “Anthrocon’’ or the Anthrocon logo. “Anthrocon’’ and the Anthrocon logo are registered servicemarks of Anthrocon, Inc. Trademark law requires that we prohibit either of these from being used unless formally licensed by Anthrocon, Inc. Such a license agreement requires Anthrocon to request a licensing fee, and that we approve the use of our servicemarks before items bearing them are produced. Unlicensed items must be removed from sale and display.

There are to be no sales in the Dealers Room except by approved Dealerships in appropriate and authorized areas, and sales outside of the Dealers Room are strictly prohibited. Sharing space at your table(s) with unapproved dealerships is not allowed.

## Guidelines on Displays

Dealers Room Staff at the convention may ask you to change, adapt, censor, or remove items from your display. You may disagree with staff decisions, but you must abide by them and take appropriate action. The Dealers Room Director has the final decision regarding what is and what is not appropriate material for display.

Pennsylvania statute defines “nudity” as “the showing of the human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering, or the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any portion thereof below the top of the nipple, or the depiction of covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.” This definition is very strict, and in the interest of being reasonable, the Anthrocon Dealers Room will provide some leeway.

Defining adult material precisely is a challenge for an art-focused fandom with creative tastes. Our definition for adult material includes but is not limited to:

* Translucent or transparent clothing that exposes genitalia or female-presenting nipples;
* Clothing that creates a detailed shape of the genitals, e.g. a “bulge” where the elements of the penis is distinct, such as presenting a distinct outline of the glans or the placement of piercings;
* Excessive violence and/or gore, including that within the context of BDSM;
* Depictions of sexual assault or rape;
* Depictions of sexual acts with “feral” characters;
* Depictions of extreme bondage or sado-masochism;
* Depictions of sexual or other bodily fluids being shown in sexual situations;
* Any graphic depiction of sexual acts;
* And any imagery prohibited under Anthrocon’s Standards Of Conduct.

Items which should only be available for purchase in the 18+ Section include but are not limited to:

* those Items which resemble male or female genitalia or orifices, whether of a realistic or fantastic nature, that are either penetrative or penetrable;
* those items which resemble male or female genitalia and are not presented as artistic works, with the exception of packers;
* BDSM and other fetish gear items, with the exception of pup hoods, harnesses, cuffs, and collars being sold strictly as costuming accessories or apparel;
* Any item intended for sexual gratification of any sort with no other significant purpose.

Adult artistic items and packers may be sold in the general Dealers Room but must be appropriately censored or kept from view.

Adult services of any sort are not permitted in any section of the Dealers Room.

If you are unsure about a particular item, please contact the Dealers Room Staff for clarification.

Artwork containing adult material may either be shielded by paper, stickers, or a similar covering; or should be kept in a clearly-marked binder which must be kept closed by the dealer when it is not being viewed by an adult customer. Binders or portfolios containing uncensored artwork must be separate from other binders. Any censoring of artwork (pixelation, blurring, censorship bars) must be to the satisfaction of Dealers Room Staff. (This rule does not apply to the 18+ Section.)

Displays of an adult nature outside the 18+ Section must be censored or partially covered; if this is not possible then the item must be removed from view. Vulgar or offensive language should also be censored. Censorship may include covering the vowel of the word or “comic” style censorship (using symbols in place of letters). Words that need to be censored include, but are not limited to, F\*ck, c\*nt, p\*ssy and c\*ck. Staff reserves the right to request other words be covered or appropriately censored.

Artwork, clothing, or other items of an appropriate but adult nature may be sold only if they are kept from public view. Such items must be covered or similarly shielded. These must be delivered to the customer in opaque packaging that obscures the mature item completely, such as a bag, envelope, or folder. If a customer has their own packaging, they may place it inside that instead. This rule applies to **both** the general Dealers Room and the 18+ Section.

Anthrocon holds each Dealer responsible for ensuring that minors are not permitted to view, handle, or be otherwise exposed to adult materials. If you are in doubt, please ask the customer for identification before allowing them to view your wares. Dealers who are found to be displaying adult-oriented items in such a fashion that they can be viewed by underage members will be afforded a single warning; further incidents may result in that dealer being ejected from the Dealers Room without refund and possible loss of Dealers Room privileges for future conventions. Minors will not be present in the 18+ Section; if you spot one, please ask them to leave or notify a Staff member immediately.

**DEALERS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, CITY OFFICIALS, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY BE PRESENT IN THE DEALERS’ ROOM AT ANY TIME DURING REGULAR HOURS WITHOUT ANNOUNCEMENT.** All signs, banners, standing displays in the Dealers Room must abide by a strict “PG” or better rating. Any signage in the 18+ Section which appears above 6’ in height must also be PG, as this may become visible over the curtains. Any display that may be damaging to Anthrocon’s public image is strictly forbidden.

**Five Senses Rule:** Your displays, merchandise, and staff should not annoy customers or other dealers with sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. This includes but is not limited to bright or flashing lights, loudspeakers, strong scents or eating other dealers. Videos, music, video games, and other audio need to be kept at a volume that does not annoy customers or other dealers; headphones are recommended if audio is an important part of your business. The Dealers Room Director and Staff have the final authority on what constitutes an annoyance and may ask to turn off or take down portions of a setup if it is found to be difficult to your neighbors. Please be mindful of your set up and how it may affect others around you.

**\*NEW FOR 2026\*** For safety reasons, displays in the Dealers Room can not exceed 15 feet in height or 10 feet for Bodega tables. This height is from the floor to the top of the display.

## Guidelines on sales and behavior

Sales are to be made only by authorized Dealerships; that includes Dealers, Dealer Assistants, or another Member of Anthrocon directly designated by a Dealer to make sales. Anthrocon recommends any person a Dealer plans to have watching their table or make sales for an extended period of time be made a Dealer Assistant.

Sales must be made in appropriate and authorized areas; this is understood to be the area of your Dealer Table within Halls A&B. Sales in the walking aisles, front and rear, and other public areas of Hall A&B or other convention space are not permitted without the express permission of the Dealers Room Director or another Director.

Anthrocon Performers may, with advance arrangement with the Dealers Room Director and Programming Director, sell merchandise near their performance space. The Performer must be a part of a registered Dealership and have a Dealer or Dealer Assistant Membership. The merchandise for remote sale must typically also be for sale at the Dealership. Contact the Events department for details.

Sales, exchanges, and barter between Dealerships are welcome and even encouraged. Taxes must still be calculated appropriately.

While all Dealers must pay appropriate Pennsylvania sales tax, it is their choice whether or not that sales tax cost is passed to the Member purchasing goods or included in listed prices.

Dealerships may accept payment in any manner as they choose, so long as sales for sales tax is calculated in US dollars. This includes cash, credit, debit, or even checks if you are equipped to handle them. If you are planning to accept cash, we strongly recommend that you have plenty of change and small bills on hand before the Dealers Room opens; Anthrocon cannot make change for you, nor can the Convention Center.

Anthrocon does not directly involve itself with transactions between Dealers and Members. However, if you have received what you believe to be counterfeit currency, believe theft has occurred, or have other similar concerns please tell staff as promptly as possible so that we can take appropriate steps. We suggest if possible having a counterfeit detection device such a special pen or blacklight if you expect to see larger bills.

Horseplay is not allowed in the Dealers Room. This includes the use of any squirt guns, silly string, or any flown, thrown, or projectile items. Anthrocon is not responsible for injuries, breakage, or loss incurred by or caused by any dealer or attendee.

Items or services that may create a mess, such as face painting, should have a disposable floor covering in order to contain the mess and make for easy cleanup. Similarly, items or services with pathogen concerns such as tattooing will require Dealers and Members to have appropriate Personal Protective Equipment and proper sanitation. Under no circumstances should any Dealer clean any item in the Convention Center washrooms.

There is a strict NO SMOKING OR VAPING policy in the Dealers Room. Furthermore, no items that generate an open flame or excessive heat may be employed. If you have an air compressor or similar motorized equipment, you must obtain clearance from the Convention Center through the Dealers Room Director prior to its use.

Electrical power is exclusively for use of the Dealerships that purchase it and is meant only for business equipment and their important personal devices. If you so wish, allowing other Dealers to use your power is allowed, but moving power outlets around to other tables or running cords of any length from one table to another is prohibited.

Dealers may feel free to spend as much or as little time at their Dealer Table during Dealer hours as they choose. However, if the staff note that a Dealer table is often unoccupied or is showing minimal merchandise during the convention, it will be noted during future curations.

Dealers are responsible for ensuring their queues and crowds are under control and not interfering with other dealerships. Queues must not be allowed to extend in front of nearby tables or to block traffic in the aisle. Dealers are permitted to place tape on the floor in front of their tables to create a queue. Dealers Room Staff can assist with creating a queue line if asked, dealers are encouraged to reach out before the convention if they know they’ll have issues with a queue to set up lines before the room opens to the public. If the Dealer Room Staff are required to repeatedly deal with an excessive or unruly queue, the dealer may be removed from the room.

While the Dealers Room is open, some staff will be acting as “Rovers”, wearing pink high-visibility vests and walking through the room. Feel free to ask them for assistance — it’s what they’re there for!

In the event of an emergency, either locate the nearest Rover or come to the Dealer Information Desk near the main entrance. Staff will provide assistance, and if necessary contact Public Safety or Medical staff.

Those in the 18+ Section are still expected to follow the rules presented in the Standards of Conduct; dealers and attendees must remain in “street legal” attire at all times, and displays of affection should remain appropriate. Leashes and leads may not be attached to collars, and adult-oriented audio must not be audible outside of the 18+ Section, with headphones strongly recommended.

Questions, complaints or concerns about the Dealers Room should be directed onsite to the Dealers Room Staff or Director. You may also feel free to contact Safety, Convention Operations, or other staff persons during the convention for appropriate issues, particularly for urgent situations. Please try to notify us of your concerns onsite and quickly if possible — we want to help you out promptly!

## Check in, set up and teardown

### Registration check in

Dealer Registration is located in Hall D/E. Be aware that you cannot enter the rest of the DLCC without first collecting your badge, and as such you will not be able to reach Halls A and B. You will need a government issued photo ID to pick up your registration, the same as attendee registration.

Dealer registration will be opening at 12 PM on Thursday, July 2, 2026. There will be a specific line only for dealers and dealer assistants to pick up their registration badges, you do not need to wait in the general attendee lines. Dealer registration tends to move fairly quickly, but be aware there can be waits during peak times such as opening and just before general dock opening.

Dealer Assistants may also pick up their preregistered assistant badges in this line. If a Dealer Assistant is not already registered, they can also register in this line. A registered Dealer must accompany anyone registering on site as a Dealer Assistant to verify that they authorize their assistant. Preregistered Dealer Assistants do not need to be accompanied by anyone but do still need their photo ID as above.

General attending badges can not be picked up at dealer registration, even if accompanying a dealer.

## Load in procedures

We are quite fortunate that the unions who are employed by the David L. Lawrence Convention Center are reasonable and have been willing to work with us on many issues. It is important that our Dealers understand the rules that will pertain to the Dealers Room:

During all setup and teardown periods, dealers may hand-carry or use a non-motorized cart to carry in their wares and materials from the concourse. Anything that is large enough to require a forklift, is motorized, or does not fit in the DLCC’s passenger elevators will need professional moving. (Dealers are not permitted to use the Convention Center’s freight elevators.) Please contact Anthrocon in advance for rates for these specialized services.

Dealers are able to drive their vehicles onto the floor of Halls A&B for unloading. Vehicles can only remain on the floor while being unloaded, and once unloaded they must be removed from the convention center immediately. Dealers may not keep their vehicles parked while setting up their tables, and all vehicles must be removed from the convention center prior to 8:30 PM on Thursday, with **no exceptions**.

The Teamsters and loading dock will be available from 12:00 pm to 3:00pm based on assigned dock entry times and 3:00 PM until 8:30 PM on Thursday to all dealers. Teamsters and the loading dock will be available from 4 PM until 8 PM on Sunday, July 7 for teardown and loadout. Because of the early opening time, vehicles are not permitted on the floor on Friday, though items can still be dropped off at the loading dock to be delivered to your table.

Dealers who wish to have things shipped in advance and delivered to the DLCC during load-in can do so via APA Exhibition Services, who provide both warehousing and delivery services for a fee. This service must be ordered and paid for before the convention; the order form for shipping and delivery will be provided about four weeks before the convention. Please note that Anthrocon has no control over this service, and will not be able to provide much in the way of assistance; issues should be brought up to APA directly.

A paid remote parking area will be provided to dealers who need to park their vehicles during the convention. It will become available on Thursday during load-in and will remain open until the following Monday. This lot is intended primarily for dealers with very large vehicles who otherwise would have difficulty parking, but any dealer is welcome to use it. Dealers will need to request parking in advance; further details are expected in early 2026 and will be passed to Dealers as soon as possible. This lot requires sign up and payment before the convention starts so please keep an eye out for that information if you will need it.

The air conditioning in Halls A&B automatically shuts off when the loading dock doors are open, except under extreme circumstances. During load-in, the room will be warm, so please dress accordingly and stay hydrated during these times. Once the doors close, the air conditioning will come back on and the room will cool down. Unfortunately this is outside of Anthrocon’s control and is up to the discretion of the Convention Center management.

All dealerships under 400 square feet may use battery-powered tools, install floor coverings, and generally avoid carpentry calls. Large Booths and Islands are currently limited to hand-powered tools installed by a single person or will require a union carpenter at additional rates.

It is important that Anthrocon maintain a strong and friendly working relationship with the local staff. If you have any disagreements or issues with any Union workers or Convention Center Staff, please bring the issue to one of the Dealers Room Staff as soon as possible; we ask that you avoid arguing with venue personnel.

### Check out and load out procedures

All Dealerships will be given a check-out form on Sunday of the convention. This form must be filled out and given to the Dealers Room staff or a designated Volunteer, who will check their area to ensure it has been packed up and is clean. This checkout procedure may begin early for small dealers who wish to leave in a hurry, but the loading dock and union labor are not available until 4 PM Sunday. Only Dealerships with a filled-out checkout form are considered ready for departure.

Anthrocon is responsible for leaving the Convention Hall in “broom clean” condition, meaning a good sweeping is all that’s necessary to finish cleaning. We are assessed a steep fee if unreasonable amounts of garbage, empty boxes, etc. are left behind when the room is vacated. Trash receptacles will be provided, especially for teardown on Sunday. Empty boxes should be broken down and bags of trash should be placed at trash cans in the aisles for convention center staff to pick up. Any Dealership that leaves an excessive amount of waste behind in their area will be responsible for a cleaning fee of not less than $100.

After the Dealers Room closes at 4:00 PM on Sunday, load-out begins in force. Dealerships are expected to rapidly pack and clean their areas to ensure a swift departure. From 4 PM onward, only Dealers and DAs are permitted presence and entry to the Dealers Room.

Dealers are permitted to drive their vehicle onto the floor for load-out once their Dealership is completely packed and their check out sheet is initialed by staff. Drivers must be either a registered Dealer or Dealer Assistant and are required to show their check out sheet before entering the ramp to the loading dock to ensure the table is ready to be loaded up. This service is completely at the discretion of Anthrocon Staff and DLCC employees, and at any point a vehicle can be denied entry to the floor. Please do not queue for the loading dock prior to 4:00 PM, or you may be cited by the city police.

Taxis or rideshare vehicles must wait in line as any other vehicle if using the loading dock. As such, they are not recommended.

The dealers room should be completely closed and cleared by 8 PM on Sunday. Your dealership space should be completely packed up and checked by staff before this time and your vehicle should be off the floor by then. Any dealerships still on the floor past 8 PM may be fined for teamster overtime and cleanup charges from the DLCC.

## Attendee entry, convention center information

At the scheduled times, the Dealers Room will open to Members. Each day, there is an initial period where Sponsors, Supersponsors, and Ultrasponsors will be permitted entry before General Admission. We will do our best to control the crowd and avoid a ‘mob rush’, but be prepared for a rush of people.

On Friday, the Dealers Room will use a “rolling queue” or “Shinjuku Method” system to manage crowds, which breaks the queue into smaller groups managed by Public Safety. At 11:30 AM, Ultrasponsors, then Supersponsors, and finally Sponsors will be allowed into Hall B via a doorway in the north-eastern corner. This will be a controlled queue, and be complete before Noon. Once that queue has been cleared, General Attendees will be allowed to enter from Hall C. There will be a strict limit on how many people can be in this queue to stay under capacity, and our Public Safety staff will be controlling how fast people can enter to avoid a mob rush. The Dealers Staff will do our very best to keep dealers informed as the rolling open proceeds.

Anthrocon does not provide wireless internet service for the Dealers Room. Instead, Dealers will need to purchase either daily or weekend access from the Convention Center’s showNet service directly. More information on using showNet can be found at https://www.anthrocon.org/wireless-internet. Please note that the Dealers Room Staff will not be able to provide support for showNet, and dealers with questions or issues should contact showNet support directly.

While the halls are monitored by security cameras, they are covering large areas of the room from significant height and the footage does not provide much detail. Dealers are allowed to place cameras at their tables for security purposes. These cameras should not be publicly streaming, and camera footage or stills must not be posted publicly online during or after the convention. If you feel camera footage needs to be reviewed by Anthrocon, please contact the Dealers Room Staff directly. Anthrocon cannot insure lost, damaged, or stolen items or provide security for your dealership.

After closing, all doors to Halls A and B from the concourse will be locked and secured, and the gates to the loading ramp will be closed and secured outside of load-in and load-out. All halls and concourses will be monitored by Public Safety until 12:00 AM, at which time DLCC Security will take over. Additionally, security cameras will be monitoring the inside of Halls A and B at all times. At no time will the area be unmonitored or will unauthorized persons be allowed in. All doors from the outside as well as the Westin skybridge will be locked overnight.

Both halls are equipped with a fire suppression system, located along the upper perimeter of the room. This system uses high volumes of constant water to ‘drown’ any fires and empty the room onto the loading dock or concourse. Because of the destructive nature of this system, **no open flames are permitted in the Dealers Room under any circumstances, and any threats about activating the fire suppression system will be taken seriously by the Staff.**

## Administrative Details

Issues arising prior to the convention should ideally be emailed to <dealers@anthrocon.org>. For simple questions, there is a Dealer Telegram group with several staff members present; formal business needs to be conducted by email or phone. While the Dealers Room does have a Twitter account, it is not a good primary way to make the staff aware of issues, and matters sent via Direct Message may be missed. During the convention, we recommend speaking directly to the Dealers Room Staff or other appropriate staff. After the convention ends, email again becomes the preferred method of communication.

All decisions made by the Dealers Room Director as to the appropriateness of display, merchandise, conduct, sales, or any other issue will be final. Refusal to follow their decision may result in ejection.

The Dealers Room Director reserves the right to revoke Dealer status, Dealer Assistant status, Dealer Tables, entire Dealerships, Memberships, Dealers Room access, or loading dock access at any time for any reason, without refund.

Any person who accepts a Dealership at Anthrocon is understood to have read the rules in the Dealer Rules & Information Packet (DRIP), as well as the complete and most recent Anthrocon Standards of Conduct, and has agreed to abide by them. Anthrocon, Inc. also reserves the right to amend these rules at any time without prior or posted notice and reserves the sole right of interpretation.
