## 2026 Charity: J and J Farms Animal Sanctuary

{{< center >}}In the heart of Western Pennsylvania, there is a place where the misunderstood, the broken and the overlooked find more than just a home—they find a family. **J and J Farms Animal Sanctuary** is proud to announce its selection as the official charity for **Anthrocon 2026**.{{< /center >}}

{{< img src="Logo.png" float="left" hint="drawing" filter="#ffffff" >}}

Founded in 2021 by Jessica Poutous and Jesse Blake, J and J Farms Animal Sanctuary isn't your average farm. It is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit "forever home" for over 175 animals who have survived atrocities such as neglect, abandonment and the brink of slaughter. From giant, 2,000-pound Belgian draft horses to tiny, bantam chickens, every resident is treated as an individual with a name, a story, and a personality all their own.

### Meet the Residents

The Sanctuary specializes in those who need a little extra love—the "misfits" and special needs residents who mirror the spirit of resilience:

<--->

**Hank:**  A Pekin duck who doesn't let a leg deformity stop him. Though he’s unable to walk, he lives life to its fullest. He can often be seen at our community events, rocking his size 2T/3T diaper, proving that "different" is just another way of being awesome.

**Liberty:**  A majestic ex-Amish Belgian draft horse who was once hours away from a tragic end, discarded for slaughter due to preventable, treatable dental issues. Today, she is a symbol of healing, having transformed from an emaciated rescue into a thriving, gentle soul.

**Raven:**  A chicken born with deformities who has become the Sanctuary’s longest-standing resident and unofficial ambassador. She even acts as a "seeing-eye chicken" companion for her blind friend, Hawkeye.

### A Labor of Love

“When we started J and J Farms Animal Sanctuary, we made a promise: once an animal steps hoof or paw onto this property, they are safe for life,” says co-founder Jessica Poutous. “We are a 100% volunteer-led organization. Every donation goes directly to the continued care of our residents. We are beyond honored to partner with Anthrocon \- a community that understands the power of identity, compassion, and belonging.”

### How You Can Help at Anthrocon

As you gather in Pittsburgh for Anthrocon 2026, your support will directly impact the lives of residents like **Ben**, the enucleated ex-Amish draft horse who was discarded in the kill pen with cancer in his remaining eye, and **Peggy**, the little chick who survived a predator attack at the expense of her leg.

{{< img src="peggy_kiski.jpg" hint="photo" float="none" caption="Peggy, a one-legged chicken">}}

Whether through the charity auction, direct donations, or simply sharing the stories of these incredible animals, the Anthrocon community is helping J and J Farms continue to say "yes" to the animals the rest of the world said "no" to.

**To meet the residents and learn more about our mission, visit [jandjfarmsanimalsanctuary.org](https://jandjfarmsanimalsanctuary.org/) or follow our daily adventures on Facebook and Instagram.**

## Bucket Brigade

At the convention, you may see some costumed performers going around with a specifically designated bucket for soliciting donations to the charity. It’s none other than our Bucket Brigade — and if you’re looking to help us raise funds, we’d love for you to be part of it.

## Charity Auction and Raffle

{{< columns >}}
{{< img src="LUA_0745.jpg" hint="picture" attr="HokuloaLuau" attrlink="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hokuloaluau" >}}

<--->

The Anthrocon Charity Auction is an event on Sunday afternoon of the convention that offers items and products unique to the convention to bidders to raise money for a charity, chosen annually by the convention.
{{< /columns >}}

The Raffle has the same purpose, but is a ticket-driven event over Friday and Saturday that accepts non-unique items and merchandise, with all winning ticket numbers presented during Sunday's Dealers Room hours. Higher value donations are sold at the auction. Lower value items are raffled at the charity's Dealers Room table.

- [Charity Donation History](/charity-event-history)

### How do I Bid in Anthrocon’s Live Charity Auction?

On Sunday of the convention, you’ll have the ability to participate as a bidder in the live Charity Auction for items that are specifically presented by our auctioneer. Check the schedule on the [Events page](/events-panels) closer to the convention dates for the exact time of the auction.

### How do I donate items to the Charity Auction?

Interested in donating to the Anthrocon Charity Auction or Raffle? Send an email to <charity@anthrocon.org> stating what you are donating, your name, your preferred email address if it's different, and details on the donation (what is it, medium, artist/donor, etc.). This information is for approval purposes only — details should be provided with the required information card at the convention.

{{< details "Rules for donating items" >}}
If you are donating an item (artwork, sculpture, animation cel, etc), it must be G to PG rated (PG13- or R-rated items accepted only with prior permission). You may either bring it to Anthrocon if you are attending or you may send it via postal mail. Write to <charity@anthrocon.org> to receive the address that postal mail items should be sent to. If delivered by mail, the item must include a 3×5 card with pertinent, legible information such as the donor, artist, medium, and any other important information a bidder or ticket-holder should know so that the item may be properly auctioned or raffled. If delivered at the convention, please do so at the charity's Dealers Room table during Dealers Room Setup hours on Friday. You will be required to fill out a 3×5 card with the aforementioned information for display and/or auction purposes. Items donated for the auction must be unique — they cannot be available anywhere else at the convention. And please: we appreciate your generosity, but do not donate multiple copies of the same item!

Additional information and more detailed rules can be found on the [Charity Event Rules](/charity-event-rules) page.

In order to support local nonprofits in a way that best relates to the convention's overall theme, the following criteria are required for an organization to be added to Anthrocon's list of candidates for consideration:

**A currently valid 501(c)(3).**

**An organization related to or associated with helping animals.**

**Parent organization headquartered within 60 miles of the Pittsburgh metro area.**

**Incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania.**

To be considered, simply contact <charity@anthrocon.org> expressing interest.

The convention's board considers candidates in December and makes a selection in January. Anthrocon's charity staff representatives make a site visit to the selected charity in February/March to validate legitimacy.
