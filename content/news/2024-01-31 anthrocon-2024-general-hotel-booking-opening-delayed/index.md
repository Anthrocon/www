## announcement: General Hotel Opening Delay

During our Supersponsor hotel opening, we received multiple reports of issues with the booking software (Passkey) not properly holding attendees’ rooms during booking. We had initially tested this system with Passkey’s tech team, but further investigation revealed underlying issues with the implementation. The fix is currently being looked into by Passkey’s technical team, but we do not currently have a timeline on when it will be resolved.

As a result, **we are delaying the General Hotel opening for Anthrocon 2024**. We apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause for those who have planned for the February 2 hotel opening. However, we wish to avoid any additional frustration of our members by trying to book a hotel room when the system is not performing as expected. We also sincerely apologize to any of our Supersponsors who were impacted by this situation.

We are working as quickly as possible with our booking partners to get the root issues fixed and implemented. At the moment, **we are targeting the week of February 5th to announce a new General hotel opening date**. An email, along with social media announcements, will be sent to all pre-registered attendees once we have confirmed the new opening date. At this time, **we will temporarily re-open our online registration for attendees**. Anyone who is pre-registered at the time that the General hotel block opens, will be eligible to book a room at one of our partner hotels.

We ask for everyone's patience as we diligently work with our booking partners to resolve the system issues. Thank you for your patience.

## Questions

**I already have a reservation through Orchid/Passkey, am I affected?**<br>
No, existing reservations that are confirmed are NOT affected. Questions about existing reservations can be emailed to help@orchid.events for assistance.

**Did Anthrocon test this system (Passkey) before it was launched?**<br>
Yes, we worked directly with Passkey to review the implementation of the booking system and were re-assured that the system was ready. The problem was only identified during the Supersponsor opening on January 30th.

**How much notice will we get when the General opening is rescheduled?**<br>
We will do our best to announce the new opening date at least three days in advance. We know this may affect attendees’ schedules and availabilities, and will take that into consideration .

**Will this affect my chances of getting a room?**<br>
While availability at nearby hotels (such as the Westin, Courtyard, Drury) are limited at this point, all our hotels within our block that are available to book. We will have our complimentary shuttle service for all attendees to get to and from the convention during each event day.

**Can I change my Registration status / level at this time?**<br>
We are re-opening Registration temporarily to allow attendees who didn’t register earlier to participate in the General opening. For questions about your existing registration, please email registration@anthrocon.org
