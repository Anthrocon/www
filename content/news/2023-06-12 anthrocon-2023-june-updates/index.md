## REGISTRATION

Online pre-registration has now ended, and those that have not yet registered but are looking to attend must buy a registration on-site.

All attendees must remember to bring their necessary documentation including government-issued photo ID and COVID-19 documentation (specifics of which can be found on our [COVID-19 Policy page](/covid-policy-2023)). For those under 18 years of age, please have your minor consent form also completed and brought to the convention. More details and forms can be found on our [Registration page](/registration).

Registration pick up times have been added to our online schedule, starting Thursday June 29th at noon for all online pre-registrations and 2pm for at-convention registrations, and starting at 9am for all other days of the convention.

## HOTELS and shuttles

Hotels should be sending confirmation emails to all attendees with bookings made through our booking partners, Orchid Events. This process will be happening until latest June 20th, so if you haven’t received the confirmation email from the hotel you’re staying at, please be patient. If you have any questions about changing details about your reservation before you get the confirmation email from your hotel, please contact Orchid at [help@orchid.events](mailto:help@orchid.events).

Reminder that hotel shuttle buses will be operating during all convention days, with maps and details available on our [At The Con page](/at-the-convention).

## Events and Panels

Our full online schedule is now online through Sched! You can either access the online schedule through their website at [anthrocon.sched.com](https://anthrocon.sched.com) or by downloading the Sched app and searching “Anthrocon 2023”.
