## Dealers Applications for Anthrocon 2026

Applications to vend at Anthrocon 2026 will be open from **October 27 at 12 PM Eastern Daylight Time** to **November 17, 2025**. Reviews and acceptance or rejections will be finalized **by January 26, 2026**. If you are a dealer’s assistant, you must wait until your dealer is approved before applying separately for a Dealer Assistant badge.

Applications can be made through our registration system. Please see the following steps for more information.

- Read [the Dealer Rules & Information Packet](/drip/) before you begin.
- Register for an account by visiting [our new registration portal](/registration/) on October 21, selecting "Register", and following the instructions.
- Once your account is registered and verified, select "Vendor" from the left menu.
- Enter your business information including your Pennsylvania tax ID, then select and complete your application for **one area only**.

You do not need to purchase a registration when applying for the dealers room, but you will need to add one to your table purchase when approvals go out. If you would like a Sponsor, Supersponsor or Ultrasponsor membership, we recommend purchasing one in advance of approvals going out. Higher tiers of membership sell out quickly and we do not hold any back for approved dealers.

## Important Information for Applying

All tables are 8 feet wide and 30 inches deep, with 7 feet of space behind each table and large aisles for customers to navigate, as well as a dealers-only aisle between the backs of tables to make it easier to move around during the day.

You must read and understand the [Dealer Rules & Information Packet (DRIP)](/drip/) and [Anthrocon’s Standards of Conduct (SOC)](/standards-of-conduct/) before registering as a dealer. Important information will be available in the DRIP. Should you have any questions not answered by the DRIP or SOC, please contact us at:

- <dealers@anthrocon.org> by email
- [@AnthroconDealer on Twitter](https://twitter.com/anthrocondealer)
- [Telegram Dealers Announcement Channel](https://t.me/anthrocondealersannounce)
- [Telegram Dealers Chat group](https://t.me/+Ut8XsuB-6oBS4fVz)

You will need your PA sales tax number (Revenue ID) to vend at Anthrocon. [Click here to apply for a PA Sales Tax License](https://mypath.pa.gov/_/). **Any application submitted that does not have a complete, valid PA Tax ID will not be eligible for curation until the Tax ID has been emailed to the Anthrocon Dealers Room staff at** <dealers@anthrocon.org>**.** This may result in your application being considered in later rounds of curation or placed on a waitlist; however, no application will be immediately rejected over a "Pending" Tax ID. It is the responsibility of the applying dealer to submit a valid Tax ID.

## WARNING: Unauthorized Service Providers

**The only legitimate providers are DLCC Event Services (Electrical power, water, other in-building services) and APA Exposition Services (tables, chairs, other furnishings). Anyone else is not authorized.**

As a dealer, you may be contacted by unauthorized service providers — for hotel/housing, audiovisual, carpet, exhibitor directory listing, etc. — who claim to be affiliated with Anthrocon. These solicitations may appear to provide cost savings; however, the rates listed could be misleading and, in some cases, the vendor may not be a credible supplier. Should you be contacted by an unauthorized service provider or have any questions, please contact VisitPittsburgh at <info@visitpittsburgh.com>. They can also be contacted by phone at [+1 844-744-7666](tel:+1-844-744-7666).
