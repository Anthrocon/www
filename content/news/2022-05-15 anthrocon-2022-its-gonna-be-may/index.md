Well, it’s already May, and we’re guessing that folks aren’t bringing back the early 2000’s boy-band pop. But we are bringing you another edition of our monthly updates leading up the convention, and with less than two months to go, we want you to be prepared and aware!

### COVID Policy

We’ve updated our COVID Policy to reflect the latest discussions and guidance, and provided some more clarity on:

- Fursuit headless zones now having fans (with additional considerations);
- Expectations for accessing the convention space;
- Acceptable types of entry tests and proofs of vaccination.

Read the full policy and its updates on [our COVID Policy page](/covidpolicy).

### Telegram Announcement Group

For those are aware of our previous Telegram Announcement Channel, we have re-created a new channel that will be used for all Anthrocon announcements and updates going forward. You can find the new channel by searching @Anthrocon on Telegram, or [joining through this link](https://t.me/Anthrocon).
