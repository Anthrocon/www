As you may have heard, Anthrocon's selected charity this year is PEARL Parrot Rescue. While cash donations made at the convention are great, the plurality of funds are raised via donations of artwork and merchandise to our Charity Auction and Raffle. We're looking for popular items and unique craftwork that will make people say, "I want that!"

Here are some examples of donations that went big in past years...

Great examples from prior raffles:

- Crafts based on hot trends ("Toothless" Build-A-Bear plus - $381)
- Popular media (Sherlock Hound DVD set - $147)
- Art bought at prior convention art shows ("Wrath" art by Terrie Smith - $83)
- Giant, brand new plush of popular animals or characters (Border collie plush - $129)
- Merchandise based on popular fiction (Dr. Who's sonic screwdriver - $158)
- Gift cards (Amazon $100 gift card - $305).

Great examples from prior auctions:

- Fursuit costumes and commissions (Griffon fursuit head - $460)
- Rare convention memorabilia (Full set of all AC t-shirts since 1997 - $200)
- Professional sculpture (Softsculp poseable gryphon - $350)
- Unique opportunities (A speaking part in audio version of Diane Duane's "The Last Meow" - $500)
- Dorsai fursuit tags (Tag #1000 - $1600)
