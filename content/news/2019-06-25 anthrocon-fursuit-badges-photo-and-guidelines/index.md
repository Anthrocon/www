## FURSUIT BADGE/PHOTO/PARADE GUIDELINES 2019

### TO GET A FURSUIT BADGE

The suit must represent an "anthro" character. Character representations of non-anthro characters, human characters, and spandex bodysuits do not count. At minimum, a headpiece, hand-paws, and a tail (if applicable by species); if using latex and makeup, it must completely cover exposed surfaces. Skin must not be visible when the costume is worn, to complete the illusion of an anthropomorphic creature. Remember, we have only a limited number of badges, which will be available outside of Operations, which is in Room 309 of the convention center.

Fursuit Badges will be given out at the following times:

- Friday: 10:30 AM to 1 PM
- Saturday: 10AM to Noon and 3 PM to 5 PM
- Sunday: 10 AM to Noon and 3 PM to 5 PM

### TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GROUP PHOTO (2:00 PM SATURDAY, JULY 6)

Character representations of non-anthro characters, human characters, spandex bodysuits, etc. are politely requested not to join in the group photo. Handlers are permitted for suits that require them, and for persons of limited mobility. You must drink at least one full glass of water before joining the parade! This is for your safety, and our sanity. You may begin to line up for the parade in Hall A of the convention center as early as 1:00 PM. The parade itself begins immediately after the group photo is taken, which will be at precisely 2:00 PM. Please allow yourself plenty of time to get there. Remember, the elevators cannot be trusted to get you there on time!

- Water will be available. Make liberal use of it!
- If you are very tall, or have tall ears or antlers, please stay to the rear of the group.
- Please line up with toes (or claws) on the tape lines that will be on the floor.
- No showboating! This photo is for everyone, not just for you. Stay with the group.
- Non-costumers must not try to “photobomb” the photo. Your membership may be suspended if you do.
- Handlers, please get out of camera shot while the photo is being taken
- Hands must be kept down.
- No flags, signs, or other items that may block the photo are permitted.
- A portion of the front row is reserved for VIPS, young children and the physically challenged.
- Remember, if you cannot see the camera, it cannot see you.
- After the photo, if you are more than 2 rows from the front, you may wish to take off your head for a breath of air.

### TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FURSUIT PARADE (2:01 PM, SATURDAY, JULY 6)

You must have an Anthrocon membership badge to participate. Please be aware that members of the public will be watching, so if you participate, you are representing not only Anthrocon, but Furry Fandom as a whole to the folks who have welcomed us so warmly to their city. The parade is intended as a showpiece for fursuit design and performance; it is not an opportunity for political statements or grandstanding. Any costume or accessory that is inappropriate for public view or is likely to cause shock or dismay to the good people of Pittsburgh will not be permitted to participate in the parade.

The bulk of the parade will take place outdoors and involves a circuit of 10th Street underneath the Convention Center. This is to provide maximum protection for our fursuiters from inclement weather or blazing-hot sunshine.

- Do not stop! KEEP MOVING! If the person ahead of you stops, feel free to go around them.
- If someone wants a picture, do not stop to pose. There will be a meet-and-greet afterward for photos. If you must stop, please step out of line so as not to impede the parade.

**HERE IS WHERE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT FROM LAST YEAR**: The parade will not proceed upstairs after entering the west lobby. It is simply too taxing on fursuiters, and on our resources. Instead, the parade will proceed into Hall E of the convention center, where it will end. Water will be available there.

**On the opposite side of the airwall, in Hall D, the public will be invited in for a meet-and-greet with the fursuiters.** You are not required to take part in the meet-and-greet of course, if you are not up to it. We strongly recommend that if you do take part, you arrange for a handler to meet you in there just to help keep an eye on things. If you need to take a break, you need only return to Hall E, which will not be accessible to non-fursuiters. The meet-and-greet is expected to last until approximately 4:00 PM.
