‘Tis the season to be gathering with friends, family, and loved ones as the year winds down. We hope that you’ve had a great holiday season, and as we all look forward to a new year, we’ll be starting things on a high note in 2024.

## Registration

Online pre-registration will continue to remain open until June. However, Supersponsor and Ultrasponsor levels have sold out and we have introduced a limit on the number of Sponsors that we are selling for 2024. Information on the different levels, pricing and other details can be found on our [Registration page](/registration).

Remember that having a valid registration for Anthrocon is required in order to receive the hotel booking link. More details on Anthrocon’s hotels are provided in the next section.

## Hotels

We’ve updated all hotel information and rates for the 16 partnered hotels that will be available for Anthrocon 2024. While we are working on sourcing more hotels based on our projected attendance, we encourage everyone to take a look through all the hotels and consider all the possibilities, as there may be a chance you don’t get the hotel you desire. However, all the hotels we’ve partnered with offer discounted rates compared to normal, and those outside the immediate vicinity of the convention center will offer a free shuttle service to any Anthrocon attendee. More details about booking dates and options can be found on our [Hotels page](/hotel).

Please keep in mind that hotel booking links will ONLY be sent to the emails of registered attendees - do not trust any links that are provided by non-Anthrocon sources. We’d also like to remind everyone to practice caution when looking for room shares, or if you’re approached by someone you don’t know about a room share.

## Dealers

Dealers should expect to hear back about their application status no later than January 20th, 2024 so that there is some lead time before the Dealers hotel booking window opens (on January 27th) - we ask for a little more patience while they sort through hundreds of applications. If you have questions about anything else on your application, reach out to [dealers@anthrocon.org](mailto:dealers@anthrocon.org) and they’ll be glad to help. More general information about Dealers can be found on our [Dealers page](/dealers).

## Panels, Events, and Performances

Online applications are now open for those that would like to host a panel or event at Anthrocon, or who’d like to showcase their talents on one of our live stages! This year the form has been consolidated into a single form for convenience, so please ensure that you’re filling out the right category. You can find all the information you need to know, along with the application link on our [Events page](/events-panels)!

## Volunteering and Staffing

With our convention continuing to grow bigger and better each year, our team is also looking to grow in the same direction. From helping out in-person with crowd control and logistics to helping support and moderate our online community channels, we’d love to hear from you if you’re interested. It’s also a great way to gain practical experience in event running, get to know new friends, and give back to a great community. More information on opportunities and how to apply can be found on our [Volunteer page](/volunteer).

On behalf of the volunteer and staff team behind Anthrocon, we hope you have a fantastic holiday season and see you in the new year!
