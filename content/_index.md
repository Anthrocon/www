{{< center >}}# **Welcome to Anthrocon**{{< /center >}}

Join us for our annual convention every summer as we celebrate anthropomorphics, which are human-like animal characters, such as have fascinated mankind since the dawn of human imagination. We are a collection of artists, animators, writers, costumers, puppeteers, and just everyday fans who enjoy cartoon animals and their kin.
