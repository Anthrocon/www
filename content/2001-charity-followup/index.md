Thanks to everyone who participated in the Anthrocon 2001 Charity Auction this year for donating money by purchasing items, donating items, and volunteering to make yet another record-setting total of$7273! My thanks to Kagemushi for co-auctioneering, the hard-working volunteers for running the items and guarding the Charity Auction tables, and to Reins of Life, our Charity this year, for participating.

Due to time constraints (we went 50 minutes overtime and ended barely 10 minutes before the Masquerade), some items had to be combined with others. I also apologize to Mikeneko for accidentally combining her wood-carving donation with Rapid T. Rabbit's videos during the rush of selling.

Below is a tally of all the items sold, including their donor and sale price. This is not the order they were sold in, nor the order they were received.
