On Friday, **February 2nd, 2018** general hotel reservations will open at **11 AM Eastern Standard Time** (GMT -0500). If we were to post the link on this website at 11 AM, the website would quickly become overwhelmed with all the requests. So instead, we will once again post the link on our various social media channels.

Shortly after 11 AM (as shown by the service at [https://time.is/](https://time.is/New_York)), the link to reserve hotel rooms will be posted in the following social media channels, in order:

- [Our Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/anthrocon)
- [Our Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Anthrocon/posts/)
- [Our Google Plus Page](https://plus.google.com/+anthrocon)
- [Our Telegram Announcement Channel](https://telegram.me/Anthrocon)

...in the event that one service is down or otherwise unreachable, we will move onto the next service. The first 3 services (Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus) do not require accounts on those services to view--the page may simply be loaded (and refreshed) in your web browser.

As room types and hotels sell out, we will post updates to our Twitter feed.

After about an hour or two, once things have calmed down, we will then update [our hotel page](https://www.anthrocon.org/hotel) with details on each hotel's remaining inventory.

## Tips For Booking A Room

- From VisitPittsburgh Housing Services: "If you know the legal names of your roommates when you make your booking, of course you can enter them, and if you have your roommates’ email addresses, enter them in the email field and your roommates will receive a copy of the reservation acknowledgment. If you do not know the true names of your roommates at the time of booking, please **do not add fake names or generic names** such as Guest #2, Guest #3. Instead, leave those names blank and then reach out to Visit Pittsburgh as described in the next step...
- If you need assistance after your reservation is made or need to add/change guests, please email **housing(at)visitpittsburgh.com** for assistance. Replies may be delayed for a day or two after reservations open due to volume.
- From PassKey: "_We recommend that you only have one browser window open. Using multiple browsers/multiple windows at the same time may cause problems._"
- While we will try to post updates when a particular hotel sells out, your best bet is the PassKey website itself. If a hotel is not listed, then it is very likely not available.

## Now that I got a room, what do I do with it?

First, please visit our [Anthrocon 2018 Hotel Reservation Experience Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHmbK7AccEyyCUfzBL4qOqIk_7epjJzIzAodOk7HtQ4nUzBQ/viewform) and let us know your thoughts on the reservation experience.

Next, [make travel plans](/getting-there)!

Finally, if you need roommates, you could ask [on our Facebook Room Share Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AnthroconRoomShare) or perhaps on **#roomshare** [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/anthrocon).
