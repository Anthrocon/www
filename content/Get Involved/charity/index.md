## 2025 Charity: Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue

{{< center >}}***“Our mission is to reduce overpopulation and euthanasia rates of cats through education, adoption, and providing a safe, loving environment for our furry friends.”***{{< /center >}}

{{< img src="N2T_Official-Logo-2color.png" float="left" hint="drawing" >}}

This year, we’re delighted to be partnering with [Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue](https://www.nose2tailcatrescue.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit, 100% donation and volunteer-run, no-kill cat rescue located in McDonald, PA.

Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue cares for 20-40 homeless cats and kittens at any given time at our rescue facility and in foster homes. Since becoming a non-profit in 2018, Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue has rescued and found homes for more than 700 cats (less than 10 of those have ever been returned to them!), helping countless families experience the joy of adoption! Their dedicated team consists of about 40 volunteers and foster families who help make their mission possible.

All donations to Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue help cover essential costs such as medical treatments, food, shelter, and other supplies, ensuring that every cat receives the care and love they need until they find their forever home. They host various events at their facility to raise money and encourage community engagement. These events include Storytime Snuggles — an opportunity for children to read to the cats in a relaxed setting; Pinot & Paws — a wine night for cat lovers; Mystic Meows — tarot readings with a feline twist; Cozy Cat Chapters — an adult silent reading program that promotes a peaceful environment for book lovers; Be in the Meow Cat Yoga, and more! In 2024 Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue hosted their first big off-site event, “Put Your Paws Up,” an amateur charity boxing event sanctioned by USA Boxing. Every dollar raised at these events goes directly toward supporting the rescue and helping cats in need.

In addition to their rescue efforts, Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue operates a mini community pet pantry called the Kitty Take-Out Pantry, located on the corner of Arabella St and E. Lincoln Ave in McDonald, right next to the rescue building. The pantry allows neighbors to give what they can and take what they need for pets in the community. Nose 2 Tail's aim is to help keep pets in their homes and discourage abandonment when pet owners face hardships.

Over the years Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue has been honored with recognition for their efforts: they were named one of City Paper “Best Places to Adopt a Pet” in 2019 and one of the Observer Reporter’s “Best Animal Rescue/Advocacy Groups” in Washington County, Greene County, and the Mon Valley in 2024. Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue was also named “Shelter of the Month” by Kitty Kasa in April 2019.

While Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue currently rents their space, they dream of building and owning a permanent cat rescue facility to help even more cats in need and expand within the community. With your support, we can make that dream a reality!

## Bucket Brigade

At the convention, you may see some costumed performers going around with a specifically designated bucket for soliciting donations to the charity. It’s none other than our Bucket Brigade — and we’d love you to be a part of it.

<--->

The Anthrocon Charity Auction is an event on Sunday afternoon of the convention that offers items and products unique to the convention to bidders to raise money for a charity, chosen annually by the convention.
{{< /columns >}}

The Raffle has the same purpose, but is a ticket-driven event over Friday and Saturday that accepts non-unique items and merchandise, with all winning ticket numbers presented during Sunday's Dealers Room hours. Higher value donations are sold at the auction. Lower value items are raffled at the charity's Dealers Room table.

- [Charity Donation History](/charity-event-history)

### How do I Bid in Anthrocon’s Live Charity Auction?

On Sunday of the convention, you’ll have the ability to participate as a bidder in the live Charity Auction for items that are specifically presented by our auctioneer. Check the schedule on the [Events page](/events-panels) closer to the convention dates for the exact time of the auction.

### How do I donate items to the Charity Auction?

Interested in donating to the Anthrocon Charity Auction or Raffle? Send an email to <charity@anthrocon.org> stating what you are donating, your name, your preferred email address if it's different, and details on the donation (what is it, medium, artist/donor, etc.). This information is for approval purposes only — details should be provided with the required information card at the convention.

{{< details "Rules for donating items" >}}
If you are donating an item (artwork, sculpture, animation cel, etc), it must be G to PG rated (PG13- or R-rated items accepted only with prior permission). You may either bring it to Anthrocon if you are attending or you may send it via postal mail. Write to <charity@anthrocon.org> to receive the address that postal mail items should be sent to. If delivered by mail, the item must include a 3×5 card with pertinent, legible information such as the donor, artist, medium, and any other important information a bidder or ticket-holder should know so that the item may be properly auctioned or raffled. If delivered at the convention, please do so at the charity's Dealers Room table during Dealers Room Setup hours on Friday. You will be required to fill out a 3×5 card with the aforementioned information for display and/or auction purposes. Items donated for the auction must be unique — they cannot be available anywhere else at the convention. And please: we appreciate your generosity, but do not donate multiple copies of the same item!

Additional information and more detailed rules can be found on the [Charity Event Rules](/charity-event-rules) page.

In order to support local nonprofits in a way that best relates to the convention's overall theme, the following criteria are required for an organization to be added to Anthrocon's list of candidates for consideration:

**A currently valid 501(c)(3).**

**An organization related to or associated with helping animals.**

**Parent organization headquartered within 60 miles of the Pittsburgh metro area.**

**Incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania.**

To be considered, simply contact <charity@anthrocon.org> expressing interest.

The convention's board considers candidates in December and makes a selection in January. Anthrocon's charity staff representatives make a site visit to the selected charity in February/March to validate legitimacy.
