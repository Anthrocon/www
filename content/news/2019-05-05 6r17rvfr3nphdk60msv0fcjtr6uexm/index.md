Hey everyone! We’ve been doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes lately, and wanted to share some news!

## Dance Competition Signups

Dance competition signups are now open! Head over to [the signup form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexT-B6OFUvcAxvMh71XNbFJC90-JTfEU5MD_8re0OjLAFBEg/viewform) to get started. Signups are online ONLY—there will be no signups at the convention itself. Please make sure that you read and understand [the Dance Competition rules](https://lastfurone.com/dance-competition-rules/).

## Hotel Update

At this time, all hotels except for the Renaissance are full! So we added an 11th hotel: The Pittsburgh Marriott City Center! Be sure to book your room [at this link](https://www.anthrocon.org/hotel)! Note that a one-night deposit is required at the time of room reservation. If there are any questions, Visit Pittsburgh Housing will be more than happy to assist! Their email address is [housing@visitpittsburgh.com](mailto:housing@visitpittsburgh.com).

Do you need a ride from the airport to your hotel? Use group code **GJXMA** [with Supershuttle and get 10% off](https://group.supershuttle.com/group-page/anthrocon-2019/)!

## Hotel Shuttle Changes

Last year we had two shuttles, but we did not feel it was enough to keep up with the load. So this year we will be running **four** shuttles to and from the hotels and convention center. Schedules and maps will be posted closer to the convention.

## Pre-Registration

Did you pre-register for Anthrocon yet? Pre-registration closes at **11:59 PM EST on June 16th, 2019**. If you want to skip the long lines at the convention, [go here to pre-register now](https://www.anthrocon.org/registration/)!

An additional note: if you buy a Supersponsorship and do so in pre-registration, that gets you a ticket to our wonderful Luncheon on Saturday with the [Guests of Honor](/goh).

## Programming Schedules

If you submitted a panel and it was approved, you should have gotten an email stating so, along with a link to the tentative schedule. If you have any questions about your panel, please email [programming@anthrocon.org](mailto:programming@anthrocon.org) immediately! Requests for changes and modifications are not handled via email. Please follow the procedure outlined in the email you received.

## Art Show

So far 136 artists have reserved space in the Art Show! There are a few panels left in both the General and Mature galleries, and some General Gallery table space, but all the Mature Gallery table space has been taken. Artists can still reserve space at [https://www.anthrocon.org/artshow/artist-info](https://www.anthrocon.org/artshow/artist-info) on a first-come, first-served basis!

That’s all we have for now, be sure to check back for more updates closer to the con, or [join us on Twitter or Facebook](https://www.anthrocon.org/social-media)!
