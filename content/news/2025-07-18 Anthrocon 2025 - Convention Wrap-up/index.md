Just as quickly as our furry family descended upon Pittsburgh, we’re now back home and still reminiscing on all the great moments and memories made. Let’s see how our voyage turned out!

### High-level summary of Anthrocon 2025

Our deep sea adventure in Pittsburgh brought out **18,357 passengers (attendees)**, spanning 21 partnered hotels and generating **over $21 million dollars in economic impact** for the city. That’s a pretty leviathan-sized event!

Additionally, our attendees raised **over $87,000 for Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue** during the convention and gave both the cats and their guardians some much-needed support to ensure they can continue their mission. On behalf of all the a-meow-zing staff and volunteers from the charity, THANK YOU!

### Attendee Feedback Survey

All attendees that picked up a badge should have received an email with a link to our 2025 Attendee Feedback Survey. We’d greatly appreciate attendees filling out the survey with their honest and constructive feedback so we can serve attendees better with future events. **The survey will be open until August 11, 2025** so don’t wait to complete it!

Don’t be scared if you see the survey size: it has skippable sections if they don’t apply to you, saves your answers on the go (if you’re logged into Google), and only takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. If you haven’t received the survey link through email, check your spam or junk folder in your inbox, or contact our feedback team at <feedback@anthrocon.org>.

### Lost & Found

With how much excitement and activity happened at Anthrocon, our Lost & Found team has a large collection of items that were unfortunately separated from their owners during the convention. While our Lost & Found team continues to sort through the mountain of belongings to re-unite them with their owners, we invite those that may have lost something in the convention center to email <lostandfound@anthrocon.org> with a detailed description and/or visual examples of item(s).

If you lost something after the convention ended on Sunday, you may need to contact the hotel you were staying or the convention center directly to see if they may have it in their possession.

### Next year’s convention

Now that our deep sea adventure has ended, the Anthrocon voyage has docked at the edge of what appears to be a rather spooky forest, where the shadows of mystery seem to swallow up any light within. What will you find in this new environment? There’s only one way to find out by joining us for **Anthrocon 2026: Critters, Cryptids, and Curses**! In addition to our theme, 2026 will be extra special for us as we celebrate our **20th Anniversary in Pittsburgh**!

Mark down the dates for our next convention, which will take place once again over the 4th of July weekend from **July 2 to July 5, 2026** at the **David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania**.

### What to look out for next

From now until September, we’ll continue to wrap up our 2025 convention. Once we’ve gotten everything closed off, we’ll be returning in the Fall with details on when Registration and Dealers applications for Anthrocon 2026 will open, then following other areas such as Events and Hotels toward the new year.
