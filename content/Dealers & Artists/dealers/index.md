## Important Information for Applying

All tables are 8 feet wide and 30 inches deep, with 7 feet of space behind each table and large aisles for customers to navigate, as well as a dealers-only aisle between the backs of tables to make it easier to move around during the day.

You must read and understand the [Dealer Rules & Information Packet (DRIP)](/drip/) and [Anthrocon’s Standards of Conduct (SOC)](/standards-of-conduct/) before registering as a dealer. Important information will be available in the DRIP. Should you have any questions not answered by the DRIP or SOC, please contact us at:

- <dealers@anthrocon.org> by email
- [@AnthroconDealer on Twitter](https://twitter.com/anthrocondealer)
- [Telegram Dealers Announcement Channel](https://t.me/anthrocondealersannounce)
- [Telegram Dealers Chat group](https://t.me/+Ut8XsuB-6oBS4fVz)

You will need your PA sales tax number (Revenue ID) to vend at Anthrocon. [Click here to apply for a PA Sales Tax License](https://mypath.pa.gov/_/). **Any application submitted that does not have a complete, valid PA Tax ID will not be eligible for curation until the Tax ID has been emailed to the Anthrocon Dealers Room staff at** <dealers@anthrocon.org>**.** This may result in your application being considered in later rounds of curation or placed on a waitlist; however, no application will be immediately rejected over a "Pending" Tax ID. It is the responsibility of the applying dealer to submit a valid Tax ID.

## WARNING: Unauthorized Service Providers

**The only legitimate providers are DLCC Event Services (Electrical power, water, other in-building services) and APA Exposition Services (tables, chairs, other furnishings). Anyone else is not authorized.**

As a dealer, you may be contacted by unauthorized service providers — for hotel/housing, audiovisual, carpet, exhibitor directory listing, etc. — who claim to be affiliated with Anthrocon. These solicitations may appear to provide cost savings; however, the rates listed could be misleading and, in some cases, the vendor may not be a credible supplier. Should you be contacted by an unauthorized service provider or have any questions, please contact VisitPittsburgh at <info@visitpittsburgh.com>. They can also be contacted by phone at [+1 844-744-7666](tel:+1-844-744-7666).
