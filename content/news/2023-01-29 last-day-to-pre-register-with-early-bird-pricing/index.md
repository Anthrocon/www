As we’ve announced on all of social media channels and on our [Registration page](/registration), today is the last day that online pre-registration will be available at the early bird price! This is also your last chance to get into the mailing list to get the Anthrocon-block hotel booking link. If you pre-register after February 2nd, the hotel booking link will be included in your registration confirmation email. However, the chances of being able to secure an Anthrocon-block hotel booking will be a lot slimmer!

We will also **temporarily close online pre-registration from January 30th until February 2nd at 11 AM Eastern,** at which time pre-registration will resume with regular pricing. More details on the rates can be found on our [Registration page](/registration). If you’ve got any questions, let our team know by sending an email to [info@anthrocon.org](mailto:info@anthrocon.org)!
