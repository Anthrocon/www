{{< center >}}## Frequently Asked Questions{{< /center >}}

**What is the clothing policy/rating at the nightly dances?**

We strive to balance creating a place of self-expression and creativity for our attendees, while also keeping in mind public decorum and our convention’s general rating. Please be mindful of this guideline - if our staff or security team finds that an article of clothing or accessory is inappropriate, we will ask you to leave the dance and come back after changing/removing it.

**What kinds of music/genre/style is played at the nightly dances?**

A variety of music genres are chosen for each night of the dances. You can expect to see the line-up (to be announced closer to convention) populated with some of the following examples:

- Pop (and Pop-remixes)
- Hip-Hop/Breakbeats
- Trap and Dubstep
- House
- Trance
- Drum & Bass

**Are the nightly dances livestreamed?**

Yes, we plan to have an official livestream on the Anthrocon channel for the in-person Main Event. Further details will be announced and posted to our website.

**Will we have coyotes invading and causing mayhem at some point?**

Probably.
