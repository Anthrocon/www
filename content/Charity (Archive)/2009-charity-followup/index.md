Hi, and welcome to the 2009 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Auction Followup!

Anthrocon raised a total of $8,992 for the Animal Rescue League Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, our charity this year. Thanks very much to Jill Argall, Tifanie Tiberio, and all the volunteers from the ARL who came out to participate.

Importantly, gratitude goes to all the donors who contributed artwork and merchandise to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid and bought raffle tickets. This is what makes the event go, so recognition of their philanthropy cannot be understated.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and our newest experiment, the charity raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Jason "creature" Murdock, Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty, and Matt "Danruk" Adey. My great appreciation also goes to Dr. Sam "Uncle Kage" Conway for his auctioneering talents which surely contributed to the highest average auction sale price ever recorded at Anthrocon.

More thanks go to 2, the Ranting Gryphon, and again to Dr. Conway for generously contributing the proceeds of their Sunday benefit comedy show to the charity.

Some raffle items were not claimed on Sunday and will be re-raffled next year.
