We have some updates regarding Registration, and the revised General Hotel Opening date.

## Registration

Online registration will be paused once again after Wednesday, February 7th at 11:59pm Eastern Time. This is to allow our team enough time to process all the new registrants in time for the link to be sent out via email.

Registration will re-open on Thursday, February 8th at 5pm Eastern Time and remain upon until June 16th, 2024. More details about Registration levels and information can be found on our [Registration page](/registration).

## General Hotel Opening

As of this writing, our **new revised date and time** for opening the General Hotel block (for Attending and Sponsors) is **Thursday, February 8th at 5pm Eastern Time**.

Some key details that you should take note of:

- **THE ROOM IS NOT HELD UNTIL YOU HAVE SELECTED IT AND THE GUEST INFORMATION PAGE COMES UP!**
- Booking links will be sent via EMAIL to all pre-registered attendees. If you register after February 8th at 5pm, you will find the booking link in your registration confirmation email.
- All questions for the General Hotel Opening should be directed to [help@orchid.events](mailto:help@orchid.events?subject=Anthrocon%20Booking%20Question), as they manage the room booking experience
