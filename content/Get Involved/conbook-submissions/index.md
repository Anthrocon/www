# Conbook Submissions & Advertising

Looking for a place to express your creativity in printed format, or advertise your business? Our official convention book is a great place to feature your skills and brand.

We’re looking for submissions of artwork, fiction, photography, and articles for publication in the 2025 conbook, and featured at our annual convention from July 3-6, 2025. Anthrocon asks for non-exclusive print rights for submitted works. The artist or author may publish the submitted work in any other fashion; previously, at the same time, and after.

**Information about advertising opportunities for 2025 can be found at [Advertising Guidelines]({{< relref "/Get Involved/advertising" >}}).**
