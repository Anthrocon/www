Springtime is fully underway with the snow melting, temperatures rising, and the days until Anthrocon quickly winding down. With so much to do and less time, here’s what’s happening this month!

If you’d prefer to hear our April updates in audio format, hosted by our content producer Harvest, check out our audio broadcast below.

## Hotel booking

Hotel bookings are still ongoing for all pre-registered attendees. Room availability will continue to be updated in the online booking portal, which can be accessed via the booking link found in your registration confirmation email. Although hotels that are directly adjacent to the convention center and unlikely to have availability, there are other options still available within our block. **Anthrocon will be providing free shuttle service** between partner hotels (excluding those directly adjacent) and the convention center, with more details and a shuttle map to be confirmed in May. If you have any questions about your existing reservation, email [help@orchid.events](mailto:help@orchid.events) for assistance.

Please remember to NEVER give out any personal information or payments if you are not sure about a room, or roommate offer. We are unable to assist you with mediation of any disputes between roommates.

## Convention Guides and Tips

We’ve got some new convention guides that will help you enjoy your convention better, whether it’s your first furry con or your umpteenth! Check out our new [Convention Tips & Guides](/tips-and-guides) section for new articles and tips from some of our staff writers. We’ll be releasing more articles and tips as the convention continues to get closer - if you have any questions or topics that you’d like to hear about, let us know on our social media channels (found below).

## Volunteering

Ever wondered what it takes to run a furry convention? The answer is simple: hardworking volunteers. Anthrocon wouldn’t be able to run smoothly - if at all - without the assistance of volunteers, and we’ll need your help to put on one of the biggest furry cons of the year. It’s a great way to learn about how they work, meet new people, and get rewarded based on volunteering time. Learn more information and sign up to volunteer on our [Volunteer page](/volunteer)!

## Art show / Artists alley

If you’re looking to submit your artwork or artisan crafts to showcase at Anthrocon’s Art Show, we are still taking applications which will be a first-come-first serve priority until all remaining spots are filled, in which case a waitlist system will be implemented. For information about our Art Show and how to apply, head over to our [Art Show page](/artshow).

If you’re a budding artist looking to show off your skills to our attendees, our Artists Alley lottery applications are still open and will remain open until May 30th.

## DJ Applications

Anthrocon’s nightly dances feature some of the best talents behind the DJ booth, accompanied by a calvacade of lights and visual effects. If you think you’ve got what it takes to make our ballroom come alive at night, our DJ applications are now open. There’s no set date for when applications will close, as once our DJ coordinator has enough entries, the form will be closed. Don’t delay submitting your demo - more information and submission form can be found on our [Nightly Dances page](/nightly-dances).

## Conbook & Advertising

Conbook and advertising opportunities will be closing on May 1st! If you haven’t started on your submission yet, you won’t want to delay any longer. We’re accepting media types such as artwork, graphics, and written short stories - if selected, your works will have a chance to be featured in our Conbook and/or other printed material at the convention. To find out more about the submission process, head over to our [Conbook page](/conbook-submissions).

## River Cruises

Tickets for Anthrocon’s River Cruises are still available! Don’t miss out on your opportunity to see some beautiful sights around Pittsburgh while cruising down the Allegheny River. If you’re feeling more romantic or prefer to cruise in style, our Dinner and Cocktail Cruise options are still available and are great options to make your convention experience stand out. For tickets and information, check out our [River Cruises page](/anthrocon-river-cruises).

## Social Media
