# Being a Good Guest at a Convention

For convention attendees, it’s reasonable to say they have a common sense obligation to treat the host venues, and their staff, with respect and integrity. It’s a simple request that is often taken for granted, but is a vital part of the relationship between Anthrocon and its host facilities, namely the David L. Lawrence Convention Center (DLCC) which houses the majority of Anthrocon’s programming, and [22 partner hotels](https://www.anthrocon.org/hotel).

## Practicing Good Sticker Etiquette

We know furries LOVE their stickers – there’s even entire panels dedicated to sticker trading - but placing them on anything that doesn’t belong to you, such as city property (lampposts, street signs) or property belonging to a venue (elevators, hotel doors, tables, etc.) is vandalism. The convention gets charged a very hefty price per sticker for removal, causing the reallocation of funds that could, and should, be used elsewhere to provide services that enhance the convention experience for all guests. Even worse than that, it can sour the relationships built between Anthrocon, our partner venues and the city of Pittsburgh - one which we try to maintain so that we’re welcomed back in future years.

To help encourage proper use of stickers in 2024, Anthrocon has introduced sticker boards that attendees can plaster with adorable adhesive art of their fursonas (and in doing so, might help raise money for charity!). One board will be located on the third floor of the DLCC in the Atrium area, near the escalators going up to the fourth floor panel rooms, and another board will take form in a GIANT 6-foot tall pizza box that will be outside of Pizza Parma (Furryland). The owners of the business don’t think we can fill out the whole board, and they’re inviting attendees to try their best - just keep it classy! If you’re looking for an easier and more shareable way of using your furry stickers, the official conbook is also a great place to show off the collection you’ve accumulated.

## Keeping Hotel Rooms Clean

Another aspect of being a good guest is maintaining an orderly hotel room. Room parties are great social fun, but they tend to generate a lot of trash – please dispose of it in proper receptacles. If you need extra bags, housekeeping will be happy to provide them. As detailed in the [Anthrocon Standards of Conduct](https://www.anthrocon.org/standards-of-conduct), rooms must be inspected at least once a day, even if the door has a “Do Not Disturb” sign; you can decline the cleaning service as long as housekeepers are able to inspect. Similarly, if you enjoy a meal or beverage inside convention space, please clean up after yourself.

## Demonstrating Courtesy and Appreciation

Good convention guests are kind and courteous to one other. Remember that we’ve traveled from all across the country, and the world, to come together and share our common love of anthropomorphics for a weekend. We all want to have a great time and make memories together, and don’t want our experience soured by a rude attendee. Also, if you particularly like someone’s fursuit, clothing, character badge, etc., letting the owner know with a compliment will at the very least bring a smile, and often make their day.

## Showing Empathy for Services and Businesses

Finally, being a good guest also involves showing kindness and empathy to those who are working to give you the best possible experience, from hotel and con staff, to waitstaff at downtown Pittsburgh’s many restaurants. As detailed in the [first guide of this series](/guides/furry-community-convention-growth/) pertaining to convention growth, Anthrocon will be experiencing unprecedented numbers in 2024, including bringing in six new hotels that previously were not partnered with the convention. Anthrocon has [expanded its shuttle bus service](https://www.anthrocon.org/shuttle-buses) to serve each of its 22 hotels across six routes, so attendees can safely and easily get to the DLCC and back to your room at any time the convention is running.

It’s important to remember that while the con has done all it could with existing resources, our newest partner hotels, as well as restaurants that have recently opened, may not be as prepared for the impact of this year’s growth. While we hope everything runs smoothly, service levels may be impacted due to the sheer number of attendees overwhelming available staffing resources. If this happens to you, a little understanding and compassion, and “thank yous” go a long way to foster a positive, long-lasting relationship between the event and our host venues that Anthrocon strives for.
