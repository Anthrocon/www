Hi, and welcome to the 2017 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Events Followup!

Anthrocon donated a new record convention total of **$37,598** for Hope Haven Farm Sanctuary,<br>
our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to Hope Haven's founder, Dr. Karen Phillips,<br/>and all her volunteers who came out to participate!

We also set new records for money raised in the Raffle and the Poker Tournament!

More special thanks are in order to the following groups and individuals:

- To all the donors who contributed artwork, merchandise, and memorabilia to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets.
- To the Dorsai Irregulars, Anthrocon's security contingent, who contributed the Elevator Golden Ticket for 2018.
- To Dr. Samuel Conway and Alkali, for their charity performance for which all ticket sales were donated to charity. Also, again to Dr. Conway for his annual auctioneering skills.
- To all the fursuiters who volunteered their time for fursuit "bucket brigade" duties.
- To the Westin, Omni, DoubleTree, and the Courtyard, who each generously offered up one or more four-night stays during Anthrocon 2018.
- To all the attendees who bought merchandise and made cash donations to Hope Haven's donation buckets at their table.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd, Tracey "Stormy" Bealer, and Tamarie "CelticKitty" Simmons, as well as the additional assistance of legacy staffer, Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty.

Unclaimed high-ticket raffle items will be re-raffled next year.

RESULTS ARE CURRENTLY TENTATIVE for few months after publication of this summary to account for additional incoming donations and human error. Corrections will be made as they are identified.
