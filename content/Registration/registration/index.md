## 2026 Registration Updates

### Pre-Registration Cap for Anthrocon 2026

Anthrocon 2026 will be limiting the number of pre-registration badges sold before the convention in accordance with safety policies set out by the venue and convention. Announcements will be made on official convention channels when pre-registration hit certain thresholds for awareness on when the limit is close.

### Registration Process for 2026

To ensure you have a smooth registration experience and secure a badge, please read over our [updated How to Register section](#how-to-register) below these updates.

### Hotel Booking Registration Policy

**You must be registered for Anthrocon in order to reserve an Anthrocon-block hotel room**. For more details on process, refer to [our Hotels page](/hotel).

### At-the-Door Membership Availability

On-site purchases will start on Friday of the convention as Thursday will be for pre-registration pickup only.

## Disclaimers for Registration Tiers

**\* Note for Sponsor, Supersponsor, and Ultrasponsor:** A portion of this membership constitutes a donation to Anthrocon which, by law, is not tax-deductible and is not refundable if your registration is canceled. For more information, please see [our refund policy](/refundpolicy).

**\*\* Note for Advance Hotel Reservations:** The higher demand hotels (such as the Westin, Courtyard and the Drury) will have a number of rooms set aside for the general reservation opening. This is done to ensure that no hotel sells out completely before the general opening and to give all attendees a chance to reserve a room in the higher demand hotels. You may see a hotel sell out during the advanced reservation period but once again have rooms available during general reservations. For more information about available hotels, see [our hotels page](/hotel).

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< details "What ID do I need to bring to get my registration?" >}}
For all attendees aged 18 years and older, we require a government-issued photo ID so that we can make sure nobody other than you is trying to pick up your badge or register in your name. Anthrocon accepts the following as a single-form ID: USA or Canada driver's license, USA or Canada state ID, USA military ID, or a passport.

For minor attendees aged 13-17 years old, we prefer to have a government-issued photo ID as well. However, we do understand that not every minor (especially the younger ones) will have an ID. If you do not have any of the above, we still need something with your photo on it that will confirm your identity and your date of birth. Contact the Registration Department at <registration@anthrocon.org> if you are unsure or need assistance in determining alternate forms of acceptable ID.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I don't have an ID. What should I do?" >}}
There are multiple options for both adults and minors to get a state-issued photo ID. Please ensure that you have a valid form of ID to get your registration badge before the convention; if you need help, consult your state or province’s government services to see what options are available.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Can I change my badge name?" >}}
Yes. Log in to your registration at <https://reg.anthrocon.org/>, then from the Attendance page under Your registration select `…` ❯ `Modify registration`.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Can I upgrade my membership after I've paid for it?" >}}
Yes! All you need to do is log in to your registration at <https://reg.anthrocon.org/>, then from the Attendance page under Your registration select `…` ❯ `Modify registration`. From here, you can upgrade your membership and update your details. Remember that quantities are limited, so they may sell out.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I am unable to stand in long lines. What can I do?" >}}
Anthrocon will have an ADA line that is available at registration for those who are unable to stand in line for whatever reason.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I have paid for a membership but cannot attend. Can I get a refund or rollover to next year?" >}}
We understand that circumstances may arise that prevent you from attending our convention. Requests for refunds must be received before the close of pre-registration. Requests for rollovers must be received before the Monday prior to the convention. For more information please visit our [refund policy page](/refundpolicy).
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I'm buying a registration badge for my child. Do I need one myself?" >}}
If your child is between the ages of 13 to 17, they do not require accompaniment within the convention space as long as they have a valid Minor badge (which requires the completion of a [Minor Consent form](#minor-forms)). If you wish to accompany them, you will need to purchase a registration badge for yourself.

Please note that children 12 and under must be accompanied by a badged adult (18 years or older) at all times, whether they purchase a PUP badge or not. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or legal guardian a signed and notarized [Parental Assignment for Supervision of Minor Child form](#minor-forms) must be completed and turned in at registration. PUP badges include the price for the child only. Membership for the parent/guardian will need to be purchased separately.
