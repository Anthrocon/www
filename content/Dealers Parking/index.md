# Oversized Lot Parking for Dealers

Anthrocon has arranged for a nearby open air parking lot to be available for Dealers with larger vehicles, vans, and trailers that are not able to utilize the surrounding parking garages. To use the parking lot, you fill out the form below and [send it in to Alco Parking](https://alcoparking.com/contact-us/) (<CustomerService@alcoparking.com>) before the convention. All forms must be received by Monday, June 30, 2025, in order to use the parking lot. This lot is set aside for Anthrocon Dealers only, but the parking lot is owned and operated by Alco Parking. Anthrocon staff are unable to answer questions or assist with parking lot issues.

This service is not available for sign-up during the convention. It must be arranged ahead of time.
