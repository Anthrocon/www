### Load-in and Load-out instructions

**Very Important Information!**

The Dealers' Room will be located in Halls A&B on the second level of the **David L. Lawrence Convention Center** in Pittsburgh, PA.

Dealers can pick up their convention badges in Hall D, on the ground floor, with entry from 10 Street. Dealer registration opens beginning noon on Thursday.

Entry points once you have your badge include:

- Through the West Lobby on 10 Street (same street as the Westin), on the ground floor. Go up the escalator and turn right to reach Halls A&B.
- Across the skybridge from the 2nd floor of the Westin. There are two elevators at the end of the skybridge. Travel up one level to #3, then cross the walkway ahead of you. At the far end, take the escalator down one level and turn left.
- Through the loading dock. This is where you should go **if you have a vehicle with significant material to directly offload**. The entrance to the loading dock is located on Ft. Duquesne Blvd. between 9 Street & 10 Street at the point where Ft. Duquesne Blvd. & 10 Street Bypass merge. Note that the loading dock allows drop-off of merchandise only! You cannot check into the Dealer's Room from here.

    The loading dock will be open for drive on service starting at noon on Thursday. There will be a staggered entry from 12-3 PM, and the dock is open for any dealer from 3-9 PM Thursday. The loading dock is open for drop off only from 8 to 11:30 AM on Friday.

    The staggered schedule from noon to 3 is based on your table location as follows:

    - 12-1 PM — Row A01-A04, Tattoo Booths, C00-I10, P00-P10, Q00-V07, X01-Y07, Y Island
    - **ORANGE GROUP**
    - 1-2 PM — Row A05-A08, B odd numbers, C11-I20, JB00-OB17, P11-P20, Q08-V13, X08-Y13, X Island
    - **BLUE GROUP**
    - 2-3 PM — Row B even numbers, C21-I25, JB18-OB38, P21-P25, Q14-V21
    - **YELLOW GROUP**
    - 3-9 PM — any dealer can enter

    If your table number crosses over two groups (ie C10/C11), your load in time will be the earliest eligible slot only. In the example of C10/C11, you would be able to load in the 12-1 PM Orange Group and not the 1-2 PM Blue Group.

    Please take very careful note of the rules regarding the transport of materials. This is something that Anthrocon has no control over, and is one of the things that all conventions our size must deal with.

    1. Dealers who need to bring a vehicle on into the convention center to unload may "drive on" via the loading dock can do so, regardless of vehicle or table size. Unbadged dealers and assistants **may** enter Halls A and B via the loading dock **for unloading only**, and are **not permitted** in any other area of the convention center under any circumstances. Once unloaded, all unbadged dealers or assistants **must** go to Registration via the outdoor East Lobby entrance to get their badges. Any dealer who is driving onto the floor must unload their vehicle completely and remove it from the hall as soon as possible; dealers are not allowed to keep their vehicle parked while they set up their tables/booths. Additionally, all vehicles must be removed from the hall 30 minutes before opening by order of the fire marshal.
    2. During all load-in and load-out periods, dealers may hand-carry or use a non-motorized cart to carry in their wares and materials from the concourse. Anything that is large enough to require a forklift or motorized cart will need professional moving. Please contact Anthrocon in advance for rates for these specialized services.
    3. If you have an amount of material that will require a motorized cart or an unreasonable number of trips back and forth, you should bring your wares to the Convention Center loading dock for load-in.
    4. **Parking is not available inside the loading dock without prior approval**. There will be an outdoor lot available for large vehicles at a reasonable daily rate; more details will be posted when they become available.
    5. Large amounts of outside food may not be brought into the Exhibit Halls, due to our agreements with the convention center. You may bring a personal meal, including beverage; a large pizza is not a personal meal, even if you are really hungry. Concession stands may be open in Hall B during the lunchtime hours (approximately 12:00 Noon to 4:00 PM Friday, 11 AM-3 PM Saturday and Sunday) as well as in Concourse B.
    6. **Please do *not* request any special services or equipment directly from the Union members**. Something as simple as asking to borrow a screwdriver may result in fees of hundreds of dollars to Anthrocon. If you have any requests, please direct them to the Dealers Room staff.
    7. If you are seeking outbound shipping, a FedEx Office is located on 960 Penn Avenue, across from the Convention Center. Please contact them for hours, and be aware they are usually closed on Sundays.
    8. Hall B is lit by both artificial and natural sunlight. There may be times when the sun will be shining directly upon your table. This is the fault of Mother Nature and beyond Anthrocon’s control; we apologize in advance if the light is too bright for a few minutes.
