[Click here to apply for a PA Sales Tax License](https://mypath.pa.gov/_/). **Any application submitted that does not have a complete, valid PA Tax ID will not be eligible for curation until a the Tax ID has been emailed to the Anthrocon dealers staff at** [dealers@anthrocon.org](mailto:dealers@anthrocon.org).
