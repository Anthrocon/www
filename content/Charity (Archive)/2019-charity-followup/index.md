Hi, and welcome to the 2019 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Events Followup!

Anthrocon donated a new convention record of **$45,852** for PEARL Parrots, our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to all of PEARL Parrots' volunteers who came out to participate!

More special thanks are in order to the following groups and individuals:

- To all the donors who contributed artwork, merchandise, and memorabilia to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets.
- To the Dorsai Irregulars, Anthrocon's security contingent, who contributed the Super Golden Ticket for 2020.
- To all the Sunday comedy show performers, for their charity performance from which all ticket sales were donated to charity. Also, as always, to Dr. Conway for his annual auctioneering skills.
- To all the fursuiters who volunteered their time for the fursuit "bucket brigade": Lotus Wolf, Sither, Rainbowz Pinata, LexxieOtter, Vira, Yizozo, Acer, Teshy, Eventide, Hubcap, Prince Mai, Alibi, Blue Mouse, Rowdy, Twitchy, Vapor, Uwe, Laszlo, Ramacal, Plague Rat, Featherbutt, Valentine Thunderfoot, and Nushaa. Congratulations to our top three fundraisers: Lotus Wolf, Prince Mai, and Teshy! And many thanks to Fizz Otter for donating the prizes.
- To all the attendees who bought merchandise and made cash donations to Pearl Parrots' donation buckets at their table.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle.

None of this could have occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd, Tracey "Stormy" Bealer, Karl "Xydexx" Jorgensen, Lynn Harris, and Sharon Yates.
