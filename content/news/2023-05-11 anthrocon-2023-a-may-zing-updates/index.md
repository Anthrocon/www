## Registration

- Online pre-registration will be open until June 11th. After that, you can buy registration at-the-door at the listed prices on our [Registration page](/registration). Note that only Attending and Sponsor levels are available, as all other premium tiers have sold out.
- Please remember that we still have a revised [COVID-19 policy](/covid-policy-2023) in effect for 2023 to help maintain a safer environment in high-density areas, and a general level of protection at our convention.

## Hotels

- Booking partners will transfer reservation info to respective hotels in early June, attendees may receive confirmation emails from the hotel they have booked at, which will include the hotel’s confirmation. The existing acknowledgement number is ONLY for use with Orchid Events.
- Hotel shuttle routes and maps are being finalized and will be publicly released by the convention. You’ll be able to find information about the shuttles on our [At The Convention page](/at-the-convention).

## Convention Guides & Tips

As we draw closer to the convention, we know that many folks are new to the world of conventions. If you’re heading to Anthrocon (or any furry convention) for the first time, or don’t know what to expect, our staff writers are creating many helpful topics on things like planning, budgeting, and experiencing a furry con. Check out our [Tips and Guides section](/tips-and-guides) to read all of our articles!

## Programming/events

To all of the panelists that were approved, you should receive an email with more details about your panel. The final schedule of events will be posted by the end of the month!

In addition, we’d like to remind dancers that applications for the [Fursuit Dance Competition](/dance-competition) and [Floor Wars](/floor-wars) are open until mid-June. Find out more details on those respective pages.

## River Cruises

We’ve still got tickets available for Anthrocon’s expanded selection of River Cruises, happening on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the convention. These one-of-a-kind cruise experiences are perfect for any occasion that needs scenic views and furry company - an outing with friends, photoshoot opportunities, a date night, or even just a way to soak in the magic of Anthrocon. Head over to our [River Cruises page](/anthrocon-river-cruises) for more details on tickets!

## Volunteering

Positions are being posted for those interested in specific roles, but we always have general needs for volunteers to help out with various tasks during the convention. More information can be found on our [Volunteer page](/volunteer).

## Art Show/Artists Alley

- Artists Alley applications will be closing on May 30th! Please ensure that you read over all the rules and details of the Artists Alley to ensure that you are applying to the right place, as it has different details compared to the Dealers Room. Information can be found on our [Artists Alley page](/alley).
- Art Show applications will be continuing on a waitlist basis until our Art Show team deems it full - so don’t wait any longer to apply for space!
