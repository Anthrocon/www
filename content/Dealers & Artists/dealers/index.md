All tables are 8 feet wide and 30 inches deep, with 7 feet of space behind each table and large aisles for customers to navigate, as well as a dealers-only aisle between the backs of tables to make it easier to move around during the day.

You must read and understand the [**Dealer Rules & Information Packet (DRIP)**](/drip) and [**Anthrocon’s Standards Of Conduct (SOC)**](/standards-of-conduct) before registering as a Dealer. Important information will be available in the DRIP. Should you have any questions not answered by the DRIP or SOC, please contact us at:

You will need your PA sales tax number (Revenue ID) to vend at Anthrocon. [**Click here to apply for a PA Sales Tax License**](https://mypath.pa.gov/_/). **Any application submitted that does not have a complete, valid PA Tax ID will not be eligible for curation until a the Tax ID has been emailed to the Anthrocon dealers staff at** [**dealers@anthrocon.org**](mailto:dealers@anthrocon.org). This may result in your application being considered in later rounds of curation or placed on a waitlist; however, no application will be immediately rejected over a "Pending" Tax ID.

As a dealer, you may be contacted by Unauthorized Service Providers — for hotel/housing, audiovisual, carpet, exhibitor directory listing, etc. — who claim to be affiliated with Anthrocon. These solicitations may appear to provide cost savings; however, the rates listed could be misleading and, in some cases, the vendor may not be a credible supplier.

{{< center >}}## Dealers Assistants{{< /center >}}

Dealer Assistants must purchase their badges separately once the Dealer application has been approved. This option will become available starting on **January 9th, 2024**. We STRONGLY recommend Dealer Assistants be named before the close of pre-registration; handling them on-site is slower for us, you, and them.
