Safety and Security are being brought in house. Currently, there are two subdivisions; Security Officers and Crowd Control.

Anthrocon's Safety Officers are responsible for working with law enforcement and facility security personnel to identify potential issues and prevent them as well as serving as a liaison between them and Anthrocon should any incidents occur. Safety Officers will be expected to document interactions to help prevent issues in the future.

Crowd Control staff are responsible for ensuring that people can get safely between places by wrangling lines, checking badges, and helping social groups find places to hang out other than in walkways.

If youâ€™re interested in signing up, please fill out the [Anthrocon 2020 Safety Staff Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCVsjhfdaBVj_I55zxhYYObWJl23B6oQZQeTsiGVMYLnO8Bg/viewform)
