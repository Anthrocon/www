Dear Anthrocon Community,

As you are well aware, the COVID-19 virus continues to make headlines as new cases, both confirmed and presumptive, are being reported worldwide. The staff of Anthrocon place the health and safety of our attendees above all other factors, and have sought guidance from a variety of informed sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, Duke University Medical Center, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Allegheny County Health Department. VisitPittsburgh has been in frequent contact with the latter two agencies for updates.

At this time, there is no intention of canceling or delaying the Anthrocon 2020 convention. None of the agencies listed above has advised either course of action. We continue to monitor the situation daily, however, and should circumstances warrant either a cancellation or rescheduling, we will issue that announcement without delay on our web site and through all of our social media outlets. Please be patient. None of us can predict the course that this epidemic will take, and to what extent – or even if – it will be a concern in July. Our only choice is to rely on the advice of the medical professionals who are best situated to offer such advice.

At this time, no U.S. medical agency is advising travelers to cancel plans to travel to Western Pennsylvania, whereas of this date no cases of COVID-19 have been reported. We have had inquiries regarding the steps Anthrocon intends to take considering the very cosmopolitan makeup of our attendees. While we cannot make definitive plans so far in advance of the convention with the future course of the epidemic still unknown, there are a number of options that we may consider. Please note that these are possible courses of action and that no firm decision has been made on any.

1. We may restrict attendance of those who are coming from areas of the world where the virus has not been contained.
2. We may request that attendees who show symptoms of illness remain away from convention space and encourage those who are ill prior to departure to consider remaining home.
3. We may suggest that attendees refrain from hugging one another. While this is, of course, a cherished tradition within our community, it is unwise in an atmosphere where contagion may be lurking.
4. We fully intend to provide hand sanitizer to our attendees, either at numerous fixed stations or in portable bottles. At this time few, if any, suppliers are able to meet the demand; however, we have already placed a substantial order for hand sanitizer which we expect to receive in May of 2020.
5. All hotels provide an ample supply of soap. There is widespread agreement among the medical community that simply washing hands often for at least 20 seconds at a time is the most effective means of stopping the spread of coronaviruses such as COVID-19.
6. In the event that local, national, or international health authorities advise that the convention not take place, we may be forced to cancel or postpone the event. Should that be necessary, we will make a decision at that time as to the disposition of membership fees that have been paid to date.

Once again, we do not intend to cancel or postpone Anthrocon’s 2020 convention; however, we must continue to monitor developments and to seek advice from the medical and emergency management communities. We will update our attendees as soon as possible should our plans have to change.
