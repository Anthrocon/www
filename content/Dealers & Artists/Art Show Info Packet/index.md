# Art Show Info Packet

The Art Show Reservations Information Packet (aka the ASRIP) contains rules, instructions, and important information for artists who want to participate in the Art Show. Please read it carefully.

Last year, more than 170 artists displayed almost 2300 pieces with sales of over $110,000. Because of this, we have no need to charge a fee in advance for space reservations, but we do collect a commission of 15% of sales to cover the expenses of running the Art Show. *(Anthrocon is a registered not-for-profit organization — neither Anthrocon nor its staff profit from this.)*

The Art Show takes place in several meeting rooms on the third floor of the convention center, in an atmosphere reminiscent of an art gallery. Flat art is hung on the walls of the rooms and on portable room dividers in the center of some rooms. Tables for 3–D artwork are set up in the center of some rooms.

Please be realistic in estimating how much space you’ll need. We considered charging a hanging fee in an attempt to deter people from requesting a lot of space and then giving back much of it at the con, or canceling shortly before the con. Last year, dozens of spaces ended up vacant, which other artists might have been able to use if they’d been available in advance. We will not charge a hanging fee this year.

If you cannot attend Anthrocon, you may enlist a friend or acquaintance to act as an agent on your behalf, but they must register for a membership in order to be admitted to the con. We no longer offer mail-in service. As our convention has grown, dealing with mail-in artwork has demanded more and more staff time that we feel should be directed to meeting the needs of attending artists, who have invested a considerable amount of time and expense to be present at the con.
