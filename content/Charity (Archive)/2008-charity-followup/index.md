Hi, and welcome to the 2008 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Auction Followup!

First, the bad news: The Charity Auction had the lowest return this year since 1999, we're sorry. There were issues, we know - some we could've fixed, others out of our hands. We are working to change for 2009. We have plans - BIG plans - that should turn things around on many levels. Stay tuned!

And now the good news: We raised a total of $3,982 for Pittsburgh Parrot Rescue, our charity this year! They also benefited from donations at their Dealers' Room table to the tune of $1,102! Kage & 2's charity benefit performance raised $3,040! Dr. Gerbasi's survey team donated $130! Anthrocon provided a matching (sorta) donation of $5,000!

All told, the convention total contributed to Pittsburgh Parrot Rescue was $13,154!

If you contributed to helping PPR this year, either by donating or buying from the auction, donating at their table, buying a ticket to the comedy show, or even just taking the Furry Survey, you have the thanks of Pittsburgh Parrot Rescue and Anthrocon. (If you are a dealer who contributed a portion of your sales to PPR - not via the bucket at their table - let us know and we can adjust our figures upwards even higher!)

I'd like to give sincere thanks to my staff members who assisted me throughout the days the Charity items were displayed and during the Auction itself. These indispensable people who I rely on year after year to support the event are Jason "creature" Murdock, Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Steven "Tora" Sears, Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty, and Matt "Danruk" Adey. Extra special thanks to the Dorsai who auctioneered the full stretch: John "Bear" Hall, Dave Stein, and Dr. Robert Passovoy.

Also, a big note of gratitude to Jennifer Miller for the wonderful art that graced the promo beanie parrots that each donor received.
