- [DLCC Freight Manual (2025)](2025+ANTHROCON+SHIPPING.pdf)

With the current trend among airlines for charging higher and higher fees for baggage, you may find it advantageous to ship items directly to the Convention Center. Be advised, however, that **there is a charge to receive and handle any boxes, and that there are very specific rules to follow.** Anthrocon has helped to arrange this service and done its best to negotiate reasonable rates and rules, but that is as far as we can go. We take no responsibility for misdirected shipments, neither does any location offer any guarantees. It is *strongly* recommended that you choose a carrier that offers tracking services such as DHL, UPS, Fedex, and the like. Remember, there is a charge to receive ALL boxes shipped to the DLCC. Details on rates and applicable fees can be found on the shipping forms.

Step 1) **Download and complete the** [2025 Freight Manual](2025+ANTHROCON+SHIPPING.pdf). Select Option A, B, or C on Page 2.

Step 2) If your shipment is going to arrive on or before June 30, please use the "Ship to warehouse" option. The DLCC is not receiving shipments for us this year. IF the shipment is going to arrive on or after July 1, please use the "Ship to Show Site" option.

Step 3) IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE SHIPPING SOMETHING HOME, you must provide a prepaid shipping label for any boxes shipping back from the convention.

Step 4) Fill in the payment information on Page 2, and use the handy shipping labels (you can make copies if you wish) for either warehouse or show site service as needed.

Step 5) Mail, email, or fax the form to APA Exposition Services at any of the addresses listed on the cover of the manual. Payment is due in advance, and credit cards are accepted.

*Reminder: Anthrocon is not responsible for any shipping issues, and any risks involved up to and including loss or mis-delivery of shipments are assumed by the shipper. These services have been arranged in an effort to alleviate some of the physical burden from those attendees who need to transport excess baggage to the convention and are neither operated nor guaranteed by Anthrocon, Inc.*
