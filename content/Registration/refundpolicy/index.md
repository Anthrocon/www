# Membership Refunds and Deferrals

As much as we hope everyone planning to come to Anthrocon can attend, we understand that people have events in their life that make them unable to attend even after they have registered as Members.

## Refunds

Anthrocon has the following policies in place for membership refunds, including when we *can* and *cannot* grant them:

- There is a refund deadline every year for memberships, this year it is the same as the close of Pre-registration. For Anthrocon 2026, that date is **June 26, 2026 at 11:59 PM EDT**. Refund requests after this time will not be granted. Memberships cannot be transferred after the refund deadline.
- A portion of all Sponsor, Supersponsor, or Ultrasponsor membership fees **include a non-refundable donation to Anthrocon** which will help us to provide the finest convention experience we can. As Anthrocon is a 501(c)(7) registered nonprofit organization, the portion that is considered donation is not deductible from US taxes. As a donation, **it is not refundable if a registration is canceled or downgraded**. The donation portion of each membership level as well as the total refundable amount for Anthrocon 2026 is as follows:

{{< center >}}
| Membership Level | Amount Considered a Donation |
| --- | --- |
| Attending | $0 |
| Sponsor | $30 |
| Supersponsor | $155 |
| Ultrasponsor | $880 |

## Rollovers and Deferrals

For those who find that they will be unable to attend the convention after the refund deadline, you may request that your membership be deferred to the following year. Deferred memberships have no cash value, cannot be refunded at any time, and will only be good for the following convention year. Deferred memberships cannot be downgraded to another membership type. If the deferred membership is not used the following year, it will be forfeited. Requests for deferral must be received by the Monday before the convention. For Anthrocon 2026 that date is **June 29, 2026 at 11:59 PM EDT**. Deferral requests after this time will not be granted.

## Requirements and Policies for Requests

- Refund requests should be made online. Log in through the registration portal at <https://reg.anthrocon.org/>, select `Order History` from the left menu, `{{< html >}}<i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis"></i>{{< /html >}}` and `Request Refund` from the top of your order, and enter a quantity and additional information for your request. Requests must be submitted before the deadline above.
- Deferral requests should be made by email to <refunds@anthrocon.org>. Include your **legal name**, **badge name**, and **email address used to register** to properly identify you for your request. Requests must be submitted before the deferral deadline above.
- Requests can also be made by postal mail to our [main address](https://www.anthrocon.org/contact/). Include your **legal name**, **badge name**, and **email address used to register** to properly identify you for your request. Requests made by postal mail must be received before the refund deadline above. We cannot accept requests through other channels or platforms such as Discord or social media.
- Refunds and deferrals must be approved by the person who holds the membership. If you purchase a membership for someone else, it belongs to them, and they have the right to decide if and how they wish their membership refunded or transferred, subject to Anthrocon rules.
- Anthrocon will generally attempt to refund a membership in the manner it was paid for. Due to the policies of credit card companies, any refund requests received 60 days or more after payment may not be able to be refunded by credit cards. Anthrocon will mail a check in these instances.
- You may request a transfer of membership before the refund deadline. Have the person receiving the transfer create a registration account, then include your legal name, badge name, and email address used to register, as well as the legal name and email address of the person receiving the transfer in your request. The transfer must be requested by the holder of the original membership. Once transferred, the membership is the property of the Member whose name it is now in.
- Memberships may be downgraded (Supersponsor to Sponsor, for example) if a request is made before the refund deadline and the desired membership is not sold out. The difference in the donation portion is not refundable as outlined above. This may not be used to game or exploit the early hotel booking benefit of Ultrasponsor or Supersponsor. **Any Ultrasponsor or Supersponsor who books their hotel before general availability, then downgrades or cancels their membership, will have their hotel room reservation cancelled.**
- Refunds for Dealers Room tables must be handled via the Dealers Room Director, and follow the guidelines expressed in the [Dealers Room Information Packet](https://www.anthrocon.org/drip/). Dealer and Dealer Assistant membership refunds must also be relayed to the Dealers Room Director at <dealers@anthrocon.org>.
