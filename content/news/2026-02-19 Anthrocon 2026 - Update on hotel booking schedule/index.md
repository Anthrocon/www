To our attendees,

During this year’s hotel booking for our Supersponsor block, a portion of our attendees encountered technical difficulties during the process which resulted in a frustrating experience due to system failures.

As soon as Anthrocon and Orchid Events was made aware, our teams immediately engaged with the booking platform’s support teams, and it has been escalated to the highest level for investigation and remediation before booking continues. Anthrocon is also reaching out to all affected reservations that were erroneously confirmed to remediate the issue, as well as working with Supersponsors who were also adversely affected.

Based on the current plan to repair the system and allow time to address affected Supersponsors, we have made the decision with our housing partners to postpone the General hotel block opening to **March 10, 2026**. We will also move our planned registration pause to March 8-10, reopening on March 11. We know this is not what attendees deserve nor want, and we’re doing the best we can to ensure all systems are fully fixed before we open reservations again.

We want to apologize on behalf of our booking platform partners for an experience that has not met our expectations. Our attendees deserve an excellent experience when booking their hotel rooms, and we will continue working with that goal in mind. Anthrocon and Orchid Events rely on external booking platforms to serve our attendees, but despite our best efforts, they weren’t able to deliver to attendee expectations.

We’d like to thank the attendees for their patience and understanding, and particularly to those who helped report issues and provide examples for the team to investigate. We would also like to thank our housing partners at Orchid Events for continuing to put customer service first and assisting our attendees as best as they can. Anthrocon is continually committed to improving attendee experiences throughout different stages, and we will review our future hotel booking implementation plan to better serve our community’s interests.

If you have any further questions, please send us an email at <info@anthrocon.org>.
