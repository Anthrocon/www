Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, for which there is no timely end in sight, we have been forced to make the sad decision to cancel Anthrocon 2020. We had hoped to avoid it, but it has become clear that we will not be able to provide a convention experience that is both safe and enjoyable for our attendees.

We are offering several choices to our attendees who have already paid for memberships. Kindly click the button below this to let us know what you prefer.

Please **do not contact the hotels**. All Anthrocon hotel reservations will be canceled automatically by the VisitPittsburgh Housing Office. Some hotels have already begun to issue refunds; we are still working with others to obtain a firm commitment for a date by which refunds will be completed. Remember, the hotels are operating with skeleton crews and in some cases, only one person is available to issue hundreds of refunds, one at a time.
