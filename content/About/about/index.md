Anthrocon began as Albany Anthrocon in 1997, and since then has grown into one of the largest anthropomorphics conventions in the world with a membership in 2022 of over 13,600 attendees and [over $500,000 raised for various charities](/charity-event-history). All of the finer aspects of anthropomorphic, or more commonly, "Furry" fandom, are celebrated here. [Learn more about "What is Furry?"](/what-is-furry)

## Is Anthrocon a non-profit group?

Anthrocon is a Pennsylvania-incorporated 501(c)7 not-for-profit organization. As such, Anthrocon is dedicated to keeping its cost of attendance to a minimum. Only those funds necessary to support the operation of the convention and to make preparations for the following year's convention are retained. The sole purpose of the organization is to operate a yearly convention in order to bring together devotees of anthropomorphic animals from near and far, in a relaxed atmosphere where fans of all ages may feel welcome.
