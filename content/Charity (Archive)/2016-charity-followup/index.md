Hi, and welcome to the 2016 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Events Followup!

Anthrocon raised a new record total of $32,579 for The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium, our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to Jamie Szoszorek and all their volunteers who came out to participate!

We also set a new record for money raised in the Raffle!

More special thanks are in order to the following groups and individuals:

- To all the donors who contributed artwork, merchandise, and memorabilia to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets.
- To the Dorsai Irregulars, Anthrocon's security contingent, who contributed the Elevator Golden Ticket and "Down In Front!" ticket for 2017.
- To Dr. Samuel Conway and 2, the Ranting Gryphon, for their charity performance for which all ticket sales were donated to charity. Also, again to Dr. Conway for his annual auctioneering skills.
- To all the fursuiters who volunteered their time for fursuit "bucket brigade" duties.
- To the Westin, Omni, DoubleTree, and the Courtyard, who each generously offered up one or more four-night stays during Anthrocon 2017.
- To all the attendees who bought merchandise and made cash donations to the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium's donations buckets at their table.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle.

None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd, Tracey "Stormy" Bealer, and Tamarie "CelticKitty" Simmons.

Unclaimed high-ticket raffle items will be re-raffled next year.

RESULTS ARE CURRENTLY TENTATIVE for a month or two after publication of this summary to account for additional incoming donations and human error.
