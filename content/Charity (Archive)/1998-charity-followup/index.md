Worlds of Wonder Teddy Ruxpin/Grubby combo (Snuggems & Wolfcub) - $50

During the sale of the above item, Jim Groat arrived and announced that he would annihilate the pair for the highest bid in his favor. Unfortunately or fortunately Jim lost out to a pair of collectors who had the most horrified expressions on their faces when Jim Groat made his announcement and fought valiantly to save poor TR's life.

For the life of me, I still get the giggles when I remember Kagemushi announcing, upon seeing it for the first time: "My God, roadkill!" cos Fievel looked flat as a pancake... :)
