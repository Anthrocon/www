Hi, all! For those who either donated to or purchased items from the Charity Auction, our deepest thanks for making this our second biggest year. Great thanks to our charity, Support Our Shelters (SOS), as well for providing us with a panel on their ferrets and their organization. They're already talking and networking about who they can help, asking the shelters they know and which shelters they have heard are in the most need. Put in terms of how much help they can give to the ferrets who live in shelters, the money you raised can pay for 30-50 major surgeries which can extend the lives and increase the quality of life for 30-50 ferrets!

I'd also like to thank Anthrocon's esteemed chairman, Dr. Samuel Conway, also known as Kagemushi, for his assistance in auctioneering. He is an accomplished speaker and helpful friend and talented auctioneer.

Last and certainly not least, I wish to thank my staff who worked diligently as table guards, movers, and runners throughout Friday, Saturday, and the Auction itself: Tango, AlaskanWolf, Galen, Mrianti, P.Pardus, Tet Solfire, creature, JBadger, and Trixi with additional help from Windsinger and Ka Crow. I would also like to thank Triggur and his tech staff for their photo broadcasting equipment that allowed us to see every item on the big screen on stage. That saves us a lot of effort.

In 2002, we auctioned a total of 90 items. This year, we received even more items (114) and raised $8348! I can't thank enough the generosity of those who purchased and donated cash during the Charity Auction. I also can't thank the donors enough, who selflessly provide us with material to raise money for such worthy causes year after year.
