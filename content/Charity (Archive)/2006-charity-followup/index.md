Hi, and welcome to the 2006 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Auction Followup!

We raised a healthy total of $5,855 for our charity this year, the Western Pennsylvania National Wild Animal Orphanage. They also benefited from ticket sales to Uncle Kage & 2's Comedy Show and general sales & donations to the tune of $2,552.

I'd like to give my sincere thanks to my staff members who assisted me throughout the days the Charity items were displayed and during the Auction itself. These indispensable people who I rely on year after year to support the event are Jason "creature" Murdock, Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Steven "Tora" Sears, and Lincoln "JBadger" Kliman, as well as the volunteers who assisted during the auction itself. Extra special thanks to Dr. Sam "Kagemushi" Conway for auctioneering the full three hour stretch.
