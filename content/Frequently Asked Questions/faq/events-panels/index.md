### Why don't you have more programming involving puppets (or costumes, or writing, or...)?

Anthrocon strives to provide a variety of programming events so that there is something for everyone. Our programming space is limited and we have only so many hours in the weekend; thus, if we were cater too strongly to one particular programming track, we would have to take programming space away from other tracks. If you have ideas for programming, please submit an idea through [our Events page](/programming), but please also understand that we cannot use every idea we receive.

### Can I hold my wedding at Anthrocon?

Sorry, no. We get far too many requests to honor them all.

Holding your wedding during the convention at a nearby location is perfectly acceptable, and has happened before.

### Can I propose to my significant other at Anthrocon?

Again, due to the number of requests, we are unable to offer it as part of our official programming or as a stage event. If you wish to propose to your significant other while the convention is taking place, feel free.

### Can I use Anthrocon's programming space for a private function?

Again, sorry, but no. Anthrocon needs all of its programming space. Even space that may appear to be unused is often needed for setup or for overflow from other events. We are also responsible for what happens in our programming space and cannot offer it to attendees without formal approval and planning.

### Does Anthrocon provide wi-fi for event hosts/panelists?

We don’t provide internet for our event hosts. However, we have worked out a deal with the convention center’s internet provider to have discounted wi-fi available for purchase within the convention center space. Check out our [Wireless Internet Questions page](/wireless-internet) for more details.
