With Anthrocon 2020 quickly approaching there are several changes coming to registration. While we are still working out some of the details I thought I would take this opportunity to reach out to our attendees and let them know what to expect.

## Registration is Moving

{{< img src="dlcc_registration_map_2020.jpg" alt="New location map for Anthrocon Registration. Please click the image for a larger view." hint="drawing" caption="New location map for Anthrocon Registration. Please click the image for a larger view." >}}

First and foremost, registration is changing locations. We will no longer be located on the Concourse outside of the Dealers Room. Registration will be moving into Hall D off of the West Lobby of the DLCC.

Being that we are in a new location the registration layout will also be changing. We are still working on the layout but once we have it finalized we will be posting that as well.

With registrationâ€™s move to Hall D, there will be a major change regarding the David Lawrence Convention Center. **Starting in 2020, only registered attendees with a current Anthrocon Membership (Convention) Badge will be allowed to enter the main convention areas of the DLCC.**

Those who have not picked up their Membership badge will need to enter the DLCC through the West Lobby and proceed directly to registration. Those without current membership badges will be restricted to the West Lobby and Registration in the DLCC.

Those who have their current Anthrocon Membership badge will be able to use any of the DLCC entrances: West Lobby, East Lobby, and the Sky Bridge. Children 12 years old and younger (who do not need to get badges as they get in free) will have to be accompanied by a badged adult in order to get into the DLCC.

The driving factor behind the decision to move registration and limited access to the DLCC is the safety of our attendees. We do realize that this will cause some inconvenience, especially on Thursday, as people will not be able to spread out across the DLCC before they pick up their badge. However, limiting access to the DLCC to badged individuals will allow us to provide a safer environment for our attendees.

## Registration Hours

The hours for registration will not be changing. As a reminder, the hours are as follows:

- Thursday:
    - Pre-Reg only: Noon to 2 PM
    - All Registration: 2 PM to 10 PM
- Friday: 9 AM to 10 PM
- Saturday: 10 AM to 6 PM
- Sunday: 10 AM to 4 PM

## Lost Badge and After Hours Badge Pickup

Lost & Found and After Hours Badge Pickup has been located in the DLCC room 309 for the past several years. With the new registration setup and limited access to the DLCC, we will be moving these functions to a new location. We are currently still working on the logistics of this and will post more information once it becomes available. For 2020 After Hours badge pick-up for pre-registered attendees will be returning; however, they will be handled differently. Attendees who register during the pre-registration have the opportunity to get their badge after registration closes. Starting in 2020 those who are taking advantage of the after-hours badge pick-up will be issued a temporary badge that will be good for that night only. The following morning they will need to go to registration to pick up their con badge before they can enter the DLCC again.

## Convention Bags

In order to be more environmentally friendly, Anthrocon will be transitioning from plastic to a paper convention bag. Paper bags are more easily recycled and more biodegradable if they do end up being thrown away. We will be exhausting our supply of plastic convention bags so as not to waste them and will then transition to the paper bags.
