Hi, and welcome to the 2011 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Event Followup!

Anthrocon raised a total of $11,522 for the Toonseum, our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to Joe Wos, Jim & Crystal Martin, and all the volunteers from the Toonseum who came out to participate!

Importantly, gratitude goes to all the donors who contributed artwork and merchandise to the auction and raffle, and to those who bid at the auction or bought raffle tickets. This is what makes the event go, so recognition of their philanthropy cannot be understated.

Special thanks to the Westin, Omni, and DoubleTree who each generously offered up a four-night stay during Anthrocon 2012.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd, Shaun "Stahi" Daugherty, and Kevin "Dax" Dzierwinski. My great appreciation also goes to Dr. Sam "Uncle Kage" Conway for his auctioneering talents.

More thanks go to 2, the Ranting Gryphon, and again to Dr. Conway for generously contributing the proceeds of their Sunday benefit comedy show to the charity.

Some raffle items not claimed on Sunday were donated to the Toonseum for their use.
