Things have finally started to warm up in the new year, both above the waters of Pittsburgh and down in the murky depths where our Deep Sea Adventures await! With less than four months out until our voyage, find out what’s been happening with our convention preparation — and how you can prepare too.

## Registration

Online registration continues to remain open for the 2025 convention until June 15, 2025. You’ll need a registration in order to book an Anthrocon 2025 hotel block room through our registration system, using a unique link generated once paid (subject to availability). Please note that our higher level memberships are sold out at this time, but cancellations may occur from time to time. For more information about registration accommodations and other related questions, check out the FAQ on our [Registration page]({{< relref "/Registration/registration" >}}).

## Art Show

The Anthrocon Art Show is now accepting applications! For artists that are interested in submitting artwork, make sure you read over the rules carefully and find the link at the bottom of the information documentation to sign up. Artists that sign up by March 31 are guaranteed a space in the Art Show! Details can be found on our [Art Show page]({{< relref "/Dealers & Artists/artshow" >}}), and the rules and sign-up link can be found on the [Art Show Info Packet page]({{< relref "/Dealers & Artists/Art Show Info Packet" >}}).

## Artists Alley

The Anthrocon Artists Alley is now taking online sign-ups! Information has been updated that interested artists will want to know. Online sign-ups will continue to remain open until May 30, 2025. More information and the link to sign up can be found on our [Artists Alley page]({{< relref "/Dealers & Artists/alley" >}}).

## River Cruises

River Cruise tickets are still available for all cruise types and dates throughout the main days of the convention! You won’t need your Registration badge to board a cruise as long as you have a valid cruise ticket (in case you’re worried about being in line), but you’ll need to buy the cruise ticket through our new registration portal’s Event Store. Find out dates and times, along with pricing for all options on our [River Cruises page]({{< relref "/Events/anthrocon-river-cruises" >}}).

## Charity

Our Charity has been confirmed for this year’s event: for Anthrocon 2025, we’re proud to be sponsoring the **Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue from McDonald, PA**. We know that our resident cat, Anthrocat, is quite excited to help out these feline friends, and we hope you will be too! Learn more about their organization’s cause and ways you can get involved on our [Charity page]({{< relref "/Get Involved/charity" >}}).

## Hotel Booking and Shuttles

Hotel bookings are available to registered and paid attendees through our registration system’s Hotel Reservations section. Although many of the closer preferred hotels are sold out at this time, cancellations do occur and may yield a lucky opportunity to snag a room at a close by hotel. There are still plenty of great hotel options that we’ve partnered with to provide a discounted stay, and all of our official hotel partners will be serviced by our free shuttles between the hotel and convention center all weekend long. Find out more details about partnered hotels and rates on our [Hotels page]({{< relref "/Venue/hotel" >}}).

**Beware of fake hotel offers:** if anyone else tells you they have “official” hotel rooms, they are likely attempting to scam you. Anthrocon-rate rooms are only available to paid attendees through the Registration system and by a unique email link sent directly.

**Hotel shuttles:** shuttle maps for 2025 will be updated in the month of May, and all shuttle buses will be ADA-accessible for mobility users courtesy of our 2025 service provider. Live tracking will be available for shuttles and route times, which will be announced closer to the convention. Stay tuned for more updates in May!

## Events, Panels, Stages Performances, and DJs

- **Convention schedule:** we know that attendees are eagerly awaiting our official 2025 convention schedule to be available, and our teams will be working as efficiently as possible to have an online version available around the month of May. Changes that are made beyond May will also be reflected on the live schedule, so you’ll want to check the official schedule once the convention gets here.
- **Events and panels:** applications have now closed as of March 15, 2025 and our Events team will be working hard to curate panelists and event hosts which align with our attendee interests and our hosting capabilities for this year. If you applied, you can expect to hear back from the Events team by email regarding your application status once they’ve gone through all submissions.
- **Nightly Dance DJ applications:** applications have now finished for DJs, and our team is reviewing all submissions to see which ones bring enough heat for our stages.

## Staff and Volunteer Opportunities

It’s no secret that as we grow, so does our need for motivated and passionate people to help us with that growth. If you want to be part of a passionate team of volunteers and staff, you can apply on our new registration system through the “Volunteering” option in the menu. Once you fill out the form, our Volunteering team will be in touch with you about any potential matches!

For more examples and details about being a volunteer, or how to contact us for questions about volunteering, visit our [Volunteer page]({{< relref "/Get Involved/volunteer" >}}).
