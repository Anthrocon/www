**What are the Anthrocon River Cruises?**

The River Cruises are a great way to enjoy the sights and scenery around Pittsburgh while gently cruising along the Allegheny River.

Boarding takes place at the Convention Center Riverfront Plaza, right outside the convention center. Fursuits are welcome aboard any cruise, and there will be water provided on-board.

You can board the cruise without needing to show your Anthrocon badge. However, please remember to bring your confirmed ticket with you in either electronic or printed format.

For Ultrasponsors, bring your registration badge with you as it will count as your admission.

{{< details "Can I take my fursuit onto the cruise?" >}}
Yes! The Anthrocon River Cruises welcome all fursuiters on board. However, only the Sightseeing Cruises are optimized for fursuiters and there are no dedicated changing facilities nor storage rooms on board, so please arrive already in-costume with your ticket.

There is no dedicated headless lounge on board, but there is plenty of room inside the ship to be able to rest and relax while you cool down.
