**Artists Alley:** The Anthrocon Artists Alley sign-ups have now closed and results have been sent out to artists selected in the lottery process.

### Hotels and Shuttle Transportation

**Hotel Confirmations:** Hotel reservations have been passed from our official housing partner, Orchid Events, to all of our partnered hotels. Attendees should be receiving (or have received)

**Beware of fake hotel offers:** If anyone else tells you they have “official” hotel rooms, they are likely attempting to scam you. Anthrocon-rate rooms for 2025 are no longer available to be booked at this point.

**Hotel shuttles:** Shuttle maps for 2025 will be available both online starting on the first day of the convention, along with physical printouts of your partnered hotel’s shuttle route which you can obtain at the front desk of your hotel. All shuttle buses will be ADA-accessible for mobility users and live tracking will be available for shuttles and route times.

**Gray Hare Express:** If you’re looking for an alternative way of returning to your hotel from the convention center, we are partnering with Gray Hare Express to bring attendees from the convention back to their downtown or North Shore hotels for a small fee of $5 per rider. Look for their red golf carts and friendly smiles where shuttles are dropping off attendees under the convention center!

### Charity

For Anthrocon 2025, we’re proud to be sponsoring the **Nose 2 Tail Cat Rescue from McDonald, PA**. We know that our resident cat, Anthrocat, is quite excited to help out these feline friends, and we hope you will be too!
