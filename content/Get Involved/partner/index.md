## How to Apply as a Partner

If you have a proposal that you think would benefit our community, we’d be happy to hear from you. Please note the following details before you apply.

- You must be the owner or an authorized business representative of the business or organization that is named in the application to apply as a partner. We will not accept applications made by unauthorized persons.
- Anthrocon will make an attempt to review partner applications in a timely fashion, but only those that Anthrocon identifies as a partner opportunity will be responded to via email.
- **Hotel proposals:** we are unable to consider hotel proposals that are not within the Golden Triangle neighborhood of Pittsburgh due to transportation challenges.
