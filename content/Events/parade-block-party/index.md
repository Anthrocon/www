{{< center >}}## Fursuit Parade{{< /center >}}

{{< center >}}Our annual fursuit parade will once again be going out into the streets of Pittsburgh for everyone to see!{{< /center >}}

### Parade Process

- The parade will begin with the Fursuit Parade Lineup, which will be in the convention center Hall C. The lineup for the and parade will **start at 12 PM**, with **doors closing at 1:50 PM**.
- **There is no Fursuit Group Photo before the parade.** This was a tradition in previous years but due to the sheer size of our parade line-up, it is no longer practical nor safe to host the group photo. There will be many photographers, both amateur and professional, covering the parade for all to enjoy.
- **The parade will begin at 2 PM**, starting from Hall C and leading out onto the streets underneath the convention center. For those that need physical accommodation due to not being able to take stairs/escalators, please contact [**accessibility@anthrocon.org**](mailto:accessibility@anthrocon.org) to let us know.
- The parade ends in Hall D, where there is cooling and hydration for fursuiters. **Once the parade is finished**, or fursuiters are feeling ready, they can take the elevators back up to the 3rd floor of the convention center, and make their way to Penn Avenue (either through the convention center, or the Westin) for the Block Party.

### Parade Rules

1. **All fursuiters must hydrate** before the fursuit parade. It’s for your own safety!
2. **No stopping in the parade route** - we require fursuiters to continue moving in the parade except in case of emergency. Staff and volunteers are positioned along the route should you require assistance.
3. **No flags are allowed**, as they obstruct other fursuiters in the parade.
4. **No inappropriate costumes or accessories** are allowed in the parade.
5. **People with ADA accessibility needs or young children** are permitted handlers.
6. **No photography or video is allowed inside the lineup area.** This includes selfies whether handheld or on selfie-stick.

Right after the Fursuit Parade will be the **Anthrocon Block Party**! Weather-dependent, the street of Penn Avenue (in front of the convention center) will be blocked off from 9th to 11th Street for furries and Pittsburgh locals to interact.
{{< /columns >}}

Things to keep in mind for the block party:

- **The block party is entirely outdoors!** While there will be temporary fursuit headless zones with cooling, please keep it mind that it may be very hot outside. This also means that if the weather doesn’t look good, the event may be cut short.
- We will have Anthrocon Safety staff and volunteers supporting the block party, in addition to law enforcement personnel patrolling the area.
- There will be food and refreshment services around, including some food trucks. Fursuiters should be mindful of any potential risk to their costumes.
- Restroom facilities will be available on the street in the form of portable restrooms.
