{{< center >}}## Frequently Asked Questions{{< /center >}}

{{< details "Do I need my Anthrocon registration to board the cruise?" >}}
You can board the cruise without needing to show your Anthrocon badge. However, please remember to bring your confirmed ticket with you in either electronic or printed format.

For Ultrasponsors, bring your registration badge with you as it will count as your admission.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "What time should I arrive at the waterfront dock?" >}}
Boarding will begin at the earliest time listed for each cruise. We recommend you arrive 30 minutes before the posted cruise time to allow for enough time to board.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "What boats are being used for the river cruises?" >}}
The Gateway Clipper Fleet has three boats that will be servicing our cruises, depending on the type: The Princess, The Three Rivers Queen, and The Duchess. More information about the boats can be found on the [**Gateway Clipper Fleet website**](https://www.gatewayclipper.com/about-us/boats/).
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Can I take my fursuit onto the cruise?" >}}
Yes! The Anthrocon River Cruises welcome all fursuiters on board. However, only the Sightseeing Cruises are optimized for fursuiters and there are no dedicated changing facilities nor storage rooms on board, so please arrive already in-costume with your ticket.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Is there a fursuit headless lounge on board?" >}}
There is no dedicated headless lounge on board, but there is plenty of room inside the ship to be able to rest and relax while you cool down.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "For the cocktail cruise, how do the drink tickets work?" >}}
The drink tickets are redeemable on board for any drink up to $8.50 in value. Additional drinks can be purchased.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "If I need to leave midway through the cruise, is there any option?" >}}
Unfortunately, no. Once the boat has set sailed, it will not be able to change its course. Please ensure that you have everything with you and do not have any scheduling conflicts while you are on board the cruise.
