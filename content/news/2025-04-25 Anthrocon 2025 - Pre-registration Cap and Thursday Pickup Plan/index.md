As our Chairman had shared back in October 2024, Anthrocon has been analyzing and discussing the potential need for a registration cap based on the acceptable safety standards for both the venue and the convention. We have now determined that an attendance cap for pre-registration is necessary, and will be making public announcements once we hit the thresholds of 75% full and 90% full to help manage attendee expectations. For those looking to pre-register, you can [visit our Registration page](/registration/) for more details on available memberships (while supplies last).

Additionally, we will be focusing our Registration resources to be pre-registration pickup ONLY for Thursday, July 3, so that the overall pickup experience is improved. Limited on-site registration will start on Friday, July 4, and end on Sunday, July 5. Any updates to policies for attendance or membership requirements will be communicated closer to the convention.

## Summary of Key Points

- Pre-registration will have a cap; announcements when we hit 75% and 90% capacity
- Thursday, July 3, will be pre-reg pickup ONLY; limited day passes available on-site Friday to Sunday

We know there will be questions from the community, and weâ€™ll have more updates to provide for Registration and other areas of the convention as we move closer to the summer. We welcome any feedback that our attendees may have at <feedback@anthrocon.org>.
