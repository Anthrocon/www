# Wireless Internet Questions

**How do I sign up?**

Connect to .DLCC_Premium and enjoy a flat rate $10 for 24 hours of access to wifi internet all around the convention center.

**What is covered for Dealers?**

Our deal (which we’ll just call “The Anthrocon Special” from here on out because it sounds cooler) will be the only service offered this year. It is available throughout the building, and pricing is the same as any other Anthrocon attendee.

**How long will The Anthrocon Special rate be good for?**

From the first day of convention setup until tear-down.

**I have a laptop and tablet. Can I connect both?**

Sure, but the cost will be per device.

**I have a personal Wi-Fi hotspot that uses its own data plan. Can I use that?**

Yep! You may use your own data plan as you see fit.

**Are personal hotspots or cellphone signals blocked?**

Nope! That is illegal.

**What hours of the day are covered?**

If you sign up for a single day, the connection is good for 24 hours from time of purchase. If you sign up for the entire convention, then you’ll have use of the conneciton for the entire convention.
