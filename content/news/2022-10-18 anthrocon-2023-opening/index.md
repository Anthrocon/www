With the warm weather now behind us for the year (unless you’re down south, share some with us!), our hard-working team is getting started with 2023 convention planning. Find out what’s changing for our 2023 convention as we work on finalizing details for our November launch.

## Registration

Our registration is currently scheduled to open on November 1st, with early bird pricing until January 29th, 2023! There are several important changes to our registration policies for 2023. Here’s a high-level overview of the changes, with more details to come:

- **You must be registered for Anthrocon in order to reserve an Anthrocon-block hotel room**, with room blocks starting in late January based on registration tier. For those who register before January 30th, an email will be sent out to registered attendee’s emails (depending on their tier). If you register afterwards, the link needed to reserve a hotel room will be included in the confirmation email from your registration.
- Registration will **close temporarily between January 30th and February 2nd** to allow for advance hotel booking to happen for Supersponsors and Ultrasponsors. Pre-registration will resume daytime on February 2nd in time for general hotel block booking.
- Both **Supersponsor** and **Ultrasponsor** tiers will **only be available during online pre-registration,** which ends on June 11th, 2023. You will NOT be able to purchase these tiers on-site due to limited quantities of perks/benefits.
- We will be updating our [Refund Policy page](/refundpolicy) to reflect our 2023 Registration updates. The most important update is a clarification on our refund policy for Sponsor, Supersponsor, and Ultrasponsor tiers regarding what constitutes a non-refundable “donation” based on level of membership. In addition, we have clarified rules regarding refunds that are tied to hotel bookings.

While we continue to finalize updates to pricing and policy, you can find examples of what pricing and perks could look like on our [2022 Registration page](/registration). The page will be updated with 2023 information a week before opening.

## Dealers Room Applications

Applications to be a vendor at Anthrocon 2023 will open simultaneously with pre-registration. However, please note that there are also changes to the Dealers Room policies and process.

- Dealers can apply through the same form as online pre-registration, including upgrading your membership. However, you will still need to be approved and confirmed for a Dealer’s spot. All dealers will be approved in time for hotel room reservations in late January, and a separate hotel block will be made available to approved dealers.
- The [Dealers Room Information Packet](/drip) for Dealers will be updated for 2023 by the time applications open. These will include important changes including insurance policy clarifications for all vendors, and updated vendor fees.

## Panels & Events Applications

We will be renaming the Programming department to Events! With that, we’ll be looking to open applications for hosting a panel or event at Anthrocon 2023 starting November 1st and closing on March 15, 2023. More details about panel/event rules and guidelines will be updated closer to the opening date on [our Programming page](/events-panels).

## Volunteers & Staff Signups

We know there are many folks interested in learning what it’s like to put on a convention, and we’d love to grow our team! We will have more information regarding volunteer and staff opportunities with our team coming in the next months. If you volunteered last year, you’ll be hearing from our Volunteers team soon regarding interest for 2023.
