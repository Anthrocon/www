There's no question about it, Anthrocon 2018 was an amazing success in downtown Pittsburgh this year! [Eight Thousand Four Hundred and Seven](https://twitter.com/anthrocon/status/1016066000918401025) of you made Pittsburgh a little brighter this weekend. [We raised over $42,051](/2018-charity-followup) for our charity, South Hills Pet Rescue. [1,980 of you](https://twitter.com/anthrocon/status/1015673104910217217) participated in the Annual Fursuit Parade and got to showcase Anthrocon to all to Pittsburgh! For one weekend, we made Pittsburgh just a little brighter and friendlier.
