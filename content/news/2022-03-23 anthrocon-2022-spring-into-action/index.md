Now that we’re less than 100 days out from Anthrocon, we’re ferverently hoping that the Spring season weather can help see out the cold and welcome in some excitement for the upcoming convention! There are plenty more updates for you to learn about - read on and find out what’s happening!

### **Programming**

Programming submissions have been up for some time now, but we’re looking to wrap up submissions for any new panels on April 1st (and that’s not a joke!). If you have any panel ideas you’d love to see, or are interested in hosting one yourself, head over to our [Programming page](https://www.anthrocon.org/programming) to submit.

### **Art Show**

Art Show submissions are being taken now, with those getting their application in by March 31st getting a guaranteed spot. More information can be found on our [Art Show page!](https://www.anthrocon.org/artshow)

### Conbook & Advertisement Submissions

We’re still taking submissions for our convention conbook and other advertisement mediums, whether you’re looking to show off your artistic talents or promote your business. Submissions are due no later than May 1st - find out how to submit on our [Conbook page](/conbook), or our [Advertising page](https://www.anthrocon.org/advertising).

### Registration

Don’t forget that pre-registering online for the convention is the best way to not only save yourself some money, but also save yourself the panic of asking “did I register for the convention?” when we get closer to the summer. Get your registration today - different tiers and information available on our [Registration page](/registration)!

### **Volunteers**

We’ve seen some interest come up for volunteering at the convention - we couldn’t appreciate your generosity enough. While we continue to confirm our Volunteering details for 2022, you can continue to send any of your volunteer interest to [volunteer@anthrocon.org](mailto:volunteer@anthrocon.org) and we’ll have our team get in touch with you to see where you’d fit best.

### Telegram Announcement group

For those that are aware of the previous Telegram announcement group that was used to promote Anthrocon communications and updates, we are in the process of creating a re-vamped announcement channel going forward. We plan to have this announced with next month’s updates, so stay tuned!
