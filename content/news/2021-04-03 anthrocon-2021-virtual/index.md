Do you miss Anthrocon?

Don't worry, we do too. That's why Anthrocon 2021 is going virtual! Join us online July 2nd - 4th. There's no way we'd let two years in a row pass us by. So, we've been hard at work putting together something special.

Good news, no venue means lower costs, we're not charging for attendance beyond the cost of internet of course. Just because we're stuck at home doesn't mean we can't bring our community together, but we have some ideas on how we can make the weekend an event to truly remember. If you'd like to donate to help us make that happen we've got a few perks for you. Plus you'd have our eternal gratitude.
