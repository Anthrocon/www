Hi, all! First off, I must confess that I lost my notes from the Charity Auction. I would have been completely bereft of any sort of Charity Auction summary if it hadn't been for the timely assistance of Joe Seibert (note his generous cash donation around the 2/3rds mark) who responded to my plea on a.f.f. and produced a full VHS video of the Charity Auction and mailed it to me out of the goodness of his heart. From it, I was able to piece together the majority of the auction except for a few donors' names that weren't said or I couldn't understand, and about 8 minutes (6 sales) worth of Auction. My sincere thanks to Joe for saving my bacon.

Also, thanks to Pantera (Mike Pierce) for taking the notes as the Charity Auction went along. He had the wisdom and foresight to record the sale prices on a separate sheet of paper, which I *did* retain, that gave me, at the very least, a breakdown of the prices to prove that we did, in fact, raise a hell of a lot of money.

Please feel free to reply to this email if you have information on any of the question marks (?) on the list. Each of them represents an item or donor that I don't have notes on. I will fill in this information as I get it and hopefully update with a more complete and comprehensive listing in the near future.

I'd also like to thank Anthrocon's esteemed chairman, Dr. Samuel Conway, also known as Kagemushi, for his assistance in auctioneering. He is an accomplished speaker, generous donor, and helpful friend without whom I would have to do the auction by myself and we probably wouldn't raise as much money.

Important thanks go to our Charity, of course - Canine Partners For Life. Not only were they gracious and polite guests, but they provided many of our attendees with information at their Dealer's Table in the Dealer's Room throughout the convention and even presented demonstrations throughout the day which, from what I saw, were quite well-attended. In their own words from their representative, David Monzo: "I just wanted to send a huge thank you to you and the whole Anthrocon Organization! I hope you were as pleased with the weekend as we were. Although this was our first, it seems like the conference went really well as an over all event! I have spoke with all of the staff/volunteers from Canine Partners who attended and they all had a great time (especially the dogs)."

Last and certainly not least, I wish to thank the following members of my staff who worked diligently as table guards, movers, and runners throughout Friday, Saturday, and the Auction itself: Tango, Xydexx, AlaskanWolf, Galen, Pantera, P.Pardus, Windsinger, Tet Solfire, Creature, and Trixi. I would also like to thank Triggur and his tech staff for their wonderful photo broadcasting equipment that allowed us to see every item on the big screen on stage. That saves us a LOT of effort.

In 2001, we auctioned a total of 105 items and we had to put some donated items together due to running almost 90 minutes overtime. This year, we received even more items. I apologize to any donors who were hurt that we had to put even more items together to fit into our tight schedule of only 3 hours this year, which we barely squeaked in under. Nevertheless, we still auctioned a total of 88 items.

Last year, we raised a total of $7,273. This year, we almost doubled that amount and raised $13,280! I can't thank enough the generosity of those who purchased and donated cash during the Charity Auction. I also can't thank the donors enough, who selflessly provide us with material to raise money for such worthy causes year after year.
