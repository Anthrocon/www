Hi, and welcome to the 2005 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Auction Followup!

We raised a very satisfactory total of $6,470 for our charity this year, Greater Philadelphia Search & Rescue. They also raised additional donations from the sale of "Search Critter" vests, donations at their table, and additional funds contributed during the auction - these will be reported at a later date (I wanted to get the Auction data out ASAP).

I'd like to give my sincere thanks to my staff members who assisted me throughout the days the Charity items were displayed and during the Auction itself. These indispensable people who I rely on year after year to support the event are J. Scotty "Windsinger" Emerle, Jason "creature" Murdock, Erika Leigh "Chillymouse" Rosengarten, Mike "Mrianti" Pierce, Steven "Tora" Sears, and Lincoln "JBadger" Kliman. Extra special thanks to Sam "Kagemushi" Conway and Ryan "Tet Solfire" Dewalt for auctioneering the full three hour stretch. Also thanks to Triggur, Simba_Lion and the entire A/V crew for their support in sound, lighting, and getting those photos of each item up on the big screen!
