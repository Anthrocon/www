Hi, and welcome to the 2014 edition of the Anthrocon Charity Events Followup!

Anthrocon raised a new record total of $32,372 for The National Aviary, our supported charity this year. Thanks very much to Desiree Wienand and all their volunteers from the Aviary who came out to participate - some of whom joined us as existing and new fans!

We also set new records for money raised in the Raffle, the Bucket Brigade, and 2 & Kage's Comedy Show!

More special thanks are in order to the following groups and individuals:

- To all the donors who contributed artwork and merchandise to the auction and raffle, and to all those who both bid at the auction and bought raffle tickets.
- To the Dorsai Irregulars, Anthrocon's security contingent, who contributed the Elevator Golden Ticket for 2015, raised additional funds at the elevators, and acted as the Aviary's security escorts.
- To Dr. Samuel Conway and 2, the Ranting Gryphon, for their charity performance for which all ticket sales were donated to charity. Also, again to Dr. Conway for his annual auctioneering skills.
- To all the fursuiters and their handlers who volunteered their time for fursuit "bucket brigade" duties.
- To the Westin, Omni, DoubleTree, and for the first time the Courtyard, who each generously offered up a four-night stay during Anthrocon 2015.
- To all the attendees who bought merchandise and made cash donations to The national Aviary's donations box at their table, which is always a large percentage of the total funds raised.
- To the sudden generosity of attendees at our Closing Ceremonies, who stepped up to sail us into the record books by donating over $2000 in additional cash in two minutes.

I would like to give thanks to my staff who helped conduct both the charity auction and raffle. None of this could've occurred without the assistance of Mike "Mrianti" Pierce and Trevor "Mr. Mutt" Boyd. This entire endeavor was orchestrated with the hard work of only three Anthrocon staff members!

Unclaimed high-ticket raffle items will be re-raffled next year.

Results will be tentative for a month or two after publication of this summary to account for additional incoming donations and human error.
