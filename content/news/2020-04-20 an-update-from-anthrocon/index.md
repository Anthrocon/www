Hello everyone! We know that a lot of folks are wanting information and updates regarding this year’s convention and the current situation. We’d like to give you a quick update.

Anthrocon has been in almost daily contact with VisitPittsburgh, the David Lawrence Convention Center, and/or our partner hotels. At this time, all of our contracts are still in place, and plans for this year’s convention are still progressing. That being said, there is an important development.

The governor of Pennsylvania has recently put a no-large gatherings order into effect. This order currently does not have an end date. That means we do not know if this order will have an impact on this year’s convention. We are staying in frequent communication with representatives in Pittsburgh and will be providing additional updates as more information is provided to us.

Anthrocon has also spoken with some of the local media representatives. It has been communicated to us that many in the city of Pittsburgh are very much hoping that Anthrocon will happen as planned and that they are looking forward to the return of their furry friends. Anthrocon, and the furry community, have become a welcomed presence in Pittsburgh, and we echo the feeling that we very much hope that we can hold this year’s convention as planned.

That said, we have been discussing how best to ensure the safety and health of our staff, attendees, dealers, and hosts. The Board of Directors of Anthrocon understands that there are many concerns and that government and health officials may decide it will not be safe for us to gather this year. We look to have a definitive answer by the end of May. Though we will provide updates as they become available even before then.

On a very personal note, each of our Board members wants to take a moment to wish every person, whether you are planning to attend Anthrocon or not, all the best during the current crisis. We are more than a mere conference or trade show. We are a community of friends and family. We hope that you are all safe and healthy. To those who have contracted the virus, wish you a speedy recovery. To those who may have lost someone, we send you our most heartfelt condolences. To those in the healthcare and other roles essential to our society, we take this moment to thank you for all of your work in this very stressful and tiring time. You are truly heroes, and you have our unwavering respect and gratitude.

Be safe and be well.

Your friends,

The Anthrocon Board of Directors and Staff
