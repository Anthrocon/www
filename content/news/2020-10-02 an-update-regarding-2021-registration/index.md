We hope that all our furry friends are doing well and staying safe during these trying times.

As we look towards 2021, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID and our concerns for the safety of our attendees in a large gathering, we find it necessary to delay our typical October opening of online registration.

Hotel reservation dates will also be moved to a date later than usual. We will be evaluating our options through November and into December and will continue to post updates here to let everyone know when registration will open.

We apologize for the inconvenience of this delay; attendee safety is our priority.
