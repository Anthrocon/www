It’s no secret that the furry fandom and conventions have exploded in growth over the span of just a few years. We’ve been taking into account feedback we’ve received, our own observations, and our responsibility to provide a safe, accessible, and manageable convention experience for all. In the interest of transparency and allowing attendees to make preparations, we’d like to share some of our plans — starting with Registration capacity, Thursday Pre-registration pickup, shuttle accessibility, and the size/standards of our fursuit parade.

Please watch/listen to the video below as Uncle Kage, the Chairman of Anthrocon, shares some of the important updates that the Anthrocon Board of Directors has in mind for 2025. While we continue to work on the details and specific changes, we believe that we must take these steps to ensure we can handle the growth and demands of today’s furry fandom, while balancing the complexities that our diverse community brings.

## Summary of key points

* Attendance numbers for Anthrocon 2025 will be monitored and, if necessary, will be capped should the number exceed the acceptable safety standards for our venue and our operations. Any confirmed registration cap will be announced in advance of pre-registration closure.
* Thursday Registration will be pre-registration pick up only; no Thursday passes will be available, and on-site registration will start on the Friday of the event
* Hotel Shuttles are being improved to accommodate wheelchair/ADA needs on all buses, rather than an on-call bus
* The Fursuit Parade will be exploring a limit to participants, and standards for participation to help manage the parade safely (more details to be announced at a later date)

We’ll continue to work with the community to assess, plan, and implement the necessary changes so that we can continue to provide a great convention experience while maintaining and improving the overall convention feel. You can also expect more updates to be shared in the future as our team continues to plan for the biggest event yet. We welcome any feedback that our attendees may have at <feedback@anthrocon.org>.
