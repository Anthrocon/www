Many thanks this year go to [Warphammer](https://twitter.com/broadwing) and Kyreeth, for taking the fursuit photos, including the group photo during Saturday'sparade.

The big picture [can be found here](http://www.dragonscales.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=79&amp;pid=48591).

The photo is kinda big, and may cause problems in some browsers, so here are some smaller versions of the photo:

- [1,920 pixels wide](/s/anthrocon-2017-fursuit-photo-1920px.jpg)
- [5,000 pixels wide](/s/anthrocon-2017-fursuit-photo-5k.jpg)
- [21,000 pixels wide](/s/anthrocon-2017-fursuit-photo-21k.jpg)
