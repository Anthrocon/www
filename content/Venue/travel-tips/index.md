### Anthrocon Hotel shuttles

As with previous years, we will have shuttles that will run between our Anthrocon-partnered hotels so you won’t have to walk back and forth from your hotel to our convention center. [**See our shuttle schedules**](/shuttle-buses)

The closest major international airport to the convention is the [**Pittsburgh International Airport**](http://www.flypittsburgh.com/), airport code (**PIT)**. It is highly recommended due to its variety of airlines, its proximity, and the availability of public transportation. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (**LBE**) may be a consideration for those traveling from Florida, but requires a car rental and over an hour of driving to reach Pittsburgh.

Once you arrive in Pittsburgh, there are many ways to get to your hotel:

- [**The 28X "Airport Flyer"**](https://www.portauthority.org/pdfs/28X.pdf): The cheapest way to get downtown from the airport. The three “Downtown Pittsburgh" stops are the closest to our partner hotels. Make sure to look at the maps and timetables in the link to find the best one, and note that weekdays, Saturday and Sunday schedules all differ.
- [**Pittsburgh Airport’s recommended transportation options**](https://flypittsburgh.com/pittsburgh-international-airport/ground-transport/limousines-taxis-shuttles-charter-buses/)
- Taxi or a rideshare service such as [**Uber**](https://www.uber.com/) or [**Lyft**](https://www.lyft.com/)
- [**zTrip**](https://www.ztrip.com/) - Pittsburgh's local ride-sharing service.

### Taking the Train

Anthrocon members who live in the Northeast Corridor and the upper Midwest may wish to consider taking a train to Anthrocon. It is more convenient than driving, and usually costs less than airfare. [**Amtrak**](http://www.amtrak.com/) offers rail service to the **Pittsburgh Rail Station (PGH)**, which is right across the street from the Westin Hotel, at **1100 Liberty Ave**.

The station is serviced by Amtrak's [**Capitol Limited**](https://www.amtrak.com/capitol-limited-train), running Chicago-Cleveland-Pittsburgh-Washington DC and points between, and [**Pennsylvanian**](https://www.amtrak.com/pennsylvanian-train), running Pittsburgh-Philadelphia-New York and points between.
