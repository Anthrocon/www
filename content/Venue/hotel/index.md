# Hotels for Anthrocon

{{< center >}}
Anthrocon has partnered with many hotels within the locale of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, offering special rates for our attendees.

**Online pre-registration will temporarily pause between February 23rd to 26th, 2025, to improve the general hotel booking experience, and reopen on February 27th.** A valid Anthrocon registration is required to make an Anthrocon-hotel block reservation. Register for the con on [our Registration page](/registration).

## Booking process

{{< columns >}}
Email notifications and links for the Anthrocon hotel reservation block will be sent to pre-registered members through both the Registration portal and direct email as follows (all opening times will be approximately 12 PM Eastern Time):

- Ultrasponsors: February 4th, 2025
- Dealers: February 11th, 2025
- Supersponsors: February 18th, 2025
- General (Attending/Sponsor): February 25th, 2025

{{< img src="2024 Kaze-6533.jpg" hint="picture" attr="Kaze" attrlink="https://www.furtrack.com/index/photographer:kaze_shiba" >}}
{{< /columns >}}

**A limited number of rooms will be set aside for people who are eligible for advance hotel booking (such as Ultrasponsors/Supersponsors)**. This is to allow attendees a chance to reserve a room at each hotel without having a hotel fill up before general opening. We will send the general hotel reservation link to all registered attendees on February 25th, so you will have a second chance if you do not get the hotel room of your choice during advance booking.

**Do NOT book through a hotel’s website if you want to get Anthrocon’s rates (subject to availability)**. Reservations must be made through our booking link in order to get the convention rate — if you make a reservation outside of Anthrocon's hotel block, it cannot be transferred into Anthrocon’s block.

- An email will be sent out to your registered email at the date/time listed above. If you register after the General booking date, the link needed to reserve a hotel room will be included in the confirmation email from your registration. ***Anthrocon is not responsible for lost or undeliverable emails***. Check your spam and promotional folders if you do not receive the email at the listed time.
- **If you do not know** your roommates' names or email addresses, you may put “pending” as a placeholder and then contact Orchid Events to update their information once known.
- **Only one room may be booked per registered attendee**, as it is linked to the registration.
- A one-night deposit will NOT be required. However, a valid credit card must be linked to the room reservation at the time of booking. Cancellations or changes can be made without penalty until May 16th, 2025 — after that date, cancellations will be charged a one-night penalty (room and tax) at the hotel’s rate.

## Tips for finding rooms

Are you looking for a room or roomshare offer for Anthrocon? We’ve got some important tips to remember as the process of finding a room can be tricky.

{{< columns >}}
### False or Misleading offers (Scams)

Please be aware of any suspicious room or roomshare offers, also known as a “scam”, you may receive online. Always exercise caution when interacting with anyone asking you for payment to “guarantee” a spot in a room, especially if you don’t know who they are.

<--->

### Official sources for rooms

The only place that you can get an “Anthrocon room” that is within our block is through our booking partner, Orchid Events. Anyone that may approach you indicating they can “sell” you a room at Anthrocon’s rate or lower is more than likely a scam.

<--->

### Being pressured into an offer

An important thing to look out for is anyone that attempts to persuade you, by any means, to accept an offer — that’s normally a sign that the offer isn’t as good as it seems. **Anthrocon staff and hotel employees will never try to coerce, bribe, or intimidate you with accepting an offer**.
{{< /columns >}}

If you have any suspicion about a room or roommate offer you receive, contact our Hotel team which can be found on our [Contact Us page](/contact).

## Hotel options

These rates are exclusive to rooms booked in Anthrocon’s room block (subject to availability), which can only be accessed through a special link emailed to registered attendees. All nightly rates listed below are subject to applicable state and local taxes (approximately 14%), and there will be an additional hold of $50 to $100 per night at check-in as an incidentals or damages hold which will be released back to the cardholder after checkout. Anthrocon provides shuttle service to all listed hotels outside the immediate area of the convention center.

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< details "Am I required to book a hotel room in order to attend Anthrocon?" >}}
A hotel room booking is not a requirement for attending our convention. However, make sure you’ve got a place to stay while you’re attending — we don’t want anyone to be without accommodations.

You can also consider other alternative accommodations should you not find any room within Anthrocon’s block, such as a short-term rental or a local boutique hotel.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Can I book more than one room with my registration?" >}}
No, you are only allowed to book one room per registration. We will be conducting checks to ensure that attendees are not booking multiple rooms under the same registration to keep the booking system fair for all attendees.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I am under 21 years of age. Can I reserve a hotel room?" >}}
Only certain hotels within our hotel block allow for primary guests under the age of 21. The minimum age for these hotels is 18 years old. **Please double-check the hotel you wish to book, as it will list whether the minimum booking age is 18 or 21 years old.**
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I'm not seeing rooms appear for the hotels/nights I want, are they unavailable?" >}}
Rooms are booked very quickly due to high demand, and we try to make as many rooms available on the opening date. There are separate advance blocks depending on your registration type — if you are unable to secure a room in an earlier block, you can try again when the general block opens.

If you’re unable to get the reservation you want, we would recommend securing a room at other hotels to ensure you have a place to stay during the convention. Alternatively, you can also try and find rooming arrangements with other attendees that have space (you can find these on various forums and websites).

A room may show as "not available" when only one of the nights is truly not available. This is likely to happen for the first or last night of your stay, or If you try to book a date outside the convention time frame. Try requesting a shorter stay, and if you are then able to make a successful reservation, contact [help@orchid.events](mailto:help@orchid.events) (or call **+1-800-470-8077**) and indicate that you're looking to add additional nights.

**Please note:** The higher demand hotels (such as The Westin, Courtyard, and Drury) will have a number of rooms set aside for the general reservation opening. This is done to ensure that no hotel sells out completely before the general opening and to give all attendees a chance to reserve a room in the higher demand hotels. As such you may see a hotel sell out during the advanced reservation period but once again have rooms available during general reservations.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Is there a shuttle service between the hotels?" >}}
Yes, shuttle service will be provided to all partner hotels, with the exception of The Westin, Drury, Courtyard, and AC Hotel. A shuttle route and schedule will be available closer to the event.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I'm trying to find roommates, where should I start asking?" >}}
Drop by our [Anthrocon Room Share group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AnthroconRoomShare) to get started! If Facebook is not your thing, we also have our Discord channel #roomshare on the [Official Anthrocon Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SUHnJD72JC).

Please note that Anthrocon cannot help arrange, verify, or mediate any disputes with your chosen roommates — exercise caution when interacting with new potential roommates, verify all the details are accurate on room reservations, and make sure payments made are legitimate.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "I'm having trouble with my reservation, who should I contact?" >}}
If you encounter any issues while trying to reserve a hotel room, please contact [help@orchid.events](mailto:help@orchid.events). They can also be contacted by phone at **+1-800-470-8077**. Anthrocon cannot address issues with the reservation system as it is operated and maintained by Orchid Events.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Is there a one-night deposit to book a room at Anthrocon's hotels?" >}}
There will not be a deposit taken this year; instead, we are giving people until May 16th, 2025 to cancel a reservation without penalty. After that date, any cancellations will be assessed a one-night cancellation fee at the hotel’s rate. **A credit card number is still required to make a reservation**.

A valid Anthrocon registration ID is required to make a hotel reservation — you will NOT be able to access the hotel booking system without it.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "What other fees or charges should I expect with my hotel booking?" >}}
In addition to all applicable state and local taxes, there will be an additional hold of $50 to $100 per night at check-in as an incidentals/damages hold, which will be released back to the cardholder upon checkout.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "What's the change/refund policy for Anthrocon-partnered hotels?" >}}
Anthrocon strongly recommends that its members not book a room until they are reasonably certain that their plans will not change. To change or cancel your reservation, you can use the link included in your confirmation or by contacting help@orchid.events or by phone at +1-800-470-8077.

Reservation details, including hotel type, can be **changed,** based on availability, up to June 20th without penalty.

Reservations may be **canceled** without any penalty until May 16, 2025. After that date, a one-night penalty will be charged to the cardholder on the reservation.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Are suites at hotels available to book?" >}}
Suites that are part of the Anthrocon block at our partnered hotels will be offered through the same hotel booking link through Orchid Events. Suites that are not part of Anthrocon’s block can be reserved through a hotel’s standard booking system.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "If I cancel my Anthrocon registration, do I get to keep my hotel reservation?" >}}
No, as your hotel reservation is linked to your registration. You must have a valid Anthrocon registration to keep your reservation.

In the event that you wish to transfer your room reservation to another person staying in your room, please contact [help@orchid.events](mailto:help@orchid.events?subject=Anthrocon%20reservation%20change%20request) to inform them of the transfer request.
